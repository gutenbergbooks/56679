PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p class="pfirst">The
practical portion of the present work has in part already
appeared as an article, by one of the authors, in ‘Spons’
Encyclopædia of the Industrial Arts.’ Since its publication,
however, many and important improvements have been introduced
in this, as in other branches of the art of paper-making,
which necessitated considerable additions to the
original article. It has at the same time been to a great
extent re-written, and, as the authors hope, improved.</p>

<p>Our object in writing this book has been to bring before
students and others the principles upon which scientific
paper-making should be conducted, a concise exposition of
which has not, we believe, been hitherto attempted.</p>

<p>Considerable prominence has been given to this aspect of
the subject, possibly at the expense of what some may consider
more essential details.</p>

<p>A belief in the importance of a thorough scientific training
for paper-makers has dictated the style and purpose of the
book.</p>

<p>We have not thought it necessary to enter into minute
details respecting the construction of machinery, &#x26;c.; for
these the reader is referred to such works as Hofmann’s
Treatise on the Manufacture of Paper.</p>

<p>Much of the scientific portion is here published for the first
time. Part of it has already appeared in the form of papers
read before various societies.</p>

<p>The chapter relating to the Treatment of Wood formed
the subject of an essay, which obtained the
prize offered by
the Scottish Paper-makers’ Association, in connection with
the Edinburgh Forestry Exhibition, 1884.</p>

<p>We would here express our obligations to Messrs. G. and
W. Bertram, Messrs. Masson, Scott, and Bertram, Messrs.
Rœckner and Co., and others, for their courtesy in furnishing
us with the drawings from which the illustrations were prepared;
to Dr. C. R. A. Wright, F.R.S., who kindly communicated
the substance of the chapter on the Action of
Cuprammonium on Cellulose; to Mr. Carl Christensen, for
drawings and information regarding the manufacture of
mechanical wood-pulp; also to the following friends, among
others, who have, in various ways, rendered us important
assistance:—Messrs. R. C. Menzies, C. M. King, G. E. Davis,
A. Beckwith, and C. Beadle.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth"><p>Finally, we would tender our thanks to Mr. C. G. Warnford
Lock for the care he has bestowed on the editing of the
book. The indexing and the Chapter on Statistics are
entirely his production.</p>

<div class="fsz1">PAPER-MAKING.</div>

<div class="dctr11">
 <img src="images/i001-hr.png" width="344" height="52" alt="" /> </div>

<h2 class="h2herein" title="Introductory Note.">
INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</h2>

<p class="pfirst">The raw materials of the paper-maker are primarily the
vegetable fibrous substances; in addition to these there are
various articles which are employed as auxiliaries, either in
the preparatory or finishing processes to which these fibrous
materials, or the web of paper are subjected. The latter class
are of subsidiary importance, more especially from our present
point of view.</p>

<p>In insisting upon the recognition of first principles, we
cannot overrate the importance of a thorough grasp of the
constitution of the plant fibres, as the necessary foundation
for the intelligent conduct of paper-making, and to this
subject we will at once proceed.</p>

<p>Careful study of a mature plant will show that it is made
up of structural elements of two kinds, viz. fibres and cells,
which, to use a rough parallel, we may liken in function to
the bricks and mortar of a house. It is the former which
admit of the many extended uses, with which we are familiar,
in the arts of spinning and weaving, and which constitute
the fabrics which are the most indispensable to our civilised
life. For the most part, as we know, fibres and cells are
aggregated together into compound tissues, and a process of
separation is therefore a necessary preliminary to the utilisation
of the former. The cotton fibre is the only important
exception to this general condition of distribution. Here we
have the seed envelope or perisperm,
converted into a mass <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span>
of fibres, and these by a spontaneous process accompanying
the ripening, so isolated as to be immediately available.
Next in order in point of simplicity of isolation, are those
fibrous masses, or tissues, which, although components of
complex structures, exhibit a greater cohesion of their constituent
fibres than adhesion to the contiguous cellular tissues
with which they go to build up the plant. Into such a tissue
the “bast,” or inner bark layer of shrubs and trees, more
especially those of tropical and sub-tropical regions, frequently
develops, and it is, in fact, this bast tissue, graduating in
respect of cohesion of its constituent fibres, from a close
network such as we have spoken of, to a collection of
individual fibres or fibre-bundles disposed in parallel series,
which supplies the greater part of the more valuable of the
textile and paper-making fibres; we may instance flax, hemp,
and jute, each of which is the basis of an enormous industry.
According to the degree of adhesion of the bast to the contiguous
tissues, or, in another aspect, according to its lesser
aggregate development, so is the difficulty of isolation and
the necessity of using processes auxiliary to the mechanical
separation of the tissue.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note here that the Japanese paper with
which we are in these times so familiar, is prepared by the
most primitive means from the bast of a mulberry (<i>Broussonetia
papyrifera</i>); the isolated tissue, consisting of a close
network of fibres, is simply cut and hammered to produce a
surface of the requisite evenness, and the production of a
web of paper is complete. In isolating the bast fibres
employed in the textile industries, a preliminary partial disintegration
of the plant stem is brought about by the process
of steeping or retting, by which the separation of fibre from
flesh or cellular tissue is much facilitated.</p>

<p>Last in order of simplicity of distribution, we have the
fibres known to the botanist as the fibro-vascular bundles
of leaves and mono­cot­y­le­don­ous stems, these bundles being
irregularly distributed through the main cellular mass,
and consequently, by reason of adhesion
thereto, much more <span class="xxpn" id="p003">{3}</span>
difficult of isolation. For this and other reasons, more or less
in correlation with natural function, we shall find this class
of raw material lowest in value to the paper-maker.</p>

<p>It is necessary at this stage to point out that the work of
the paper-maker and that of the textile manufacturer are
complementary one to the other, and the supply of fibrous
raw material is correspondingly divided: it may be said,
indeed, that the paper industry subsists upon the rejecta of
the textile manufactures. The working up of discontinuous
fibre elements into thread, which is the purpose of the complicated
operations of the spinner, is conditioned by the
length and strength of these ultimate fibres. Paper-making,
on the other hand, requires that the raw material shall be
previously reduced to the condition of minute subdivision of
the constituent fibres, and therefore can avail itself of fibrous
raw material altogether valueless to the spinner, and of
textile materials which from any cause have become of no
value as such. To the raw materials of the paper-maker,
which we have briefly outlined above, we must therefore add,
as a supplementary class, textiles of all kinds, such as rags,
rope, and thread.</p>

<p>Having thus acquired a general idea of the sources of our
raw materials, we must study more closely the substances
themselves, and first of all we must investigate them as we
should any other chemical substance, i.e. we must get to
understand the nature and properties of the matter of which
the vegetable fibres are composed. While these exhibit
certain variations, which are considerable, the substances
present a sufficient chemical uniformity to warrant their
being designated under a class name: this name is cellulose.
The prototype of the celluloses is the cotton fibre.</p>

CHAPTER I.
<span class="hsmall">CELLULOSE:
 <span class="fsz8">THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF TYPICAL MEMBERS OF THE
 CELLULOSE GROUP, WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR NATURAL
 HISTORY.</span></span></h2>

<p class="pfirst padtopb">Plants are so far built up of
cellulose that it may be called the material basis of the
vegetable world. Plant tissues, however, seldom, if ever,
consist of pure cellulose, but contain besides, other products
of growth either chemically combined with the cellulose or
mechanically bound up with the tissue, which are, according
to the nature of their union, removable either by means of
fundamental chemical resolution or by the application of simple
solvents. A general method for the isolation of cellulose
consists in exposing the moist tissue to the action of chlorine
gas or of bromine water in the cold, and subsequently boiling
in dilute ammonia; repeating this treatment until the alkaline
solution no longer dissolves anything from the tissue or fibre.
The cellulose is then washed with water, alcohol, and ether, and
dried. Obtained in this way, or in the form of bleached cotton,
or of Swedish filter paper, it is a white substance, more or
less opaque, retaining the microscopic features of the tissue or
fibre from which it has been isolated. Its sp. gr. is 1·25–1·45.
Its elementary composition is expressed by the percentage
numbers (Schulze)</p>

<p class="pcontinue">or by the corresponding
empirical formula, viz. C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.</p>

<p>These numbers represent the composition of the ash-free
cellulose. Nearly all celluloses contain a
certain proportion, <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span>
however small, of mineral constituents, and the union of
these with the organic portion of the fibre or tissue is of
such a nature that the ash left on ignition preserves the
form of the original. It is only in the growing point of
certain young shoots that the cellulose tissue is free from
mineral constituents. (Hofmeister.)</p>

<p>As already indicated, cellulose is insoluble in all simple
solvents; it is, however, dissolved by certain reagents, but
only by virtue of a preceding chemical modification. An
exception to this is to be found, perhaps, in the ammoniacal
solution of cupric oxide (Schweitzer’s reagent), in which it
dissolves without essential modification, being recovered by
precipitation, in a form which is chemically identical with
the original, though differing, of course, in being structureless,
or amorphous. This reagent may be employed in a
variety of forms, but the following method of using it is to
be recommended as the most certain in its results. The
substance to be operated upon is intimately mixed with
copper turnings in a tube which is narrowed below and
provided with a stopcock. Strong ammonia is poured upon
the contents of the tube and, after being allowed to stand
for some minutes, is drawn off and returned to the tube;
the operation is several times repeated until the solution of
the substance is effected. In order to facilitate the oxidation
of the copper by the atmospheric oxygen, a current of air
may be aspirated through the apparatus. The solution of
the oxide prepared in this way is more effective in its action
on cellulose than that obtained by dissolving the precipitated
hydrate in ammonia. Cellulosic tissues in contact
with this reagent are seen to undergo a disaggregation of
their fibres, which swell up, become gelatinous, and disappear
in solution. On adding an acid to the viscous
solution, a precipitate of the amorphous cellulose is obtained
in the form of a jelly resembling hydrated alumina; after
washing and drying, it forms a brownish, brittle, horny
mass. The cellulose is also precipitated upon simply diluting
the viscous solution with water and
allowing it to stand <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
8–10 days in a closed vessel. From this observation it was
inferred by Erdmann that the cellulose could not be considered
as dissolved in the strict sense of the word, but the
experiments of Cramer upon the osmotic properties of the
solution proved this inference to be unfounded, and that
cellulose is actually dissolved by the ammoniacal solution
of copper oxide.</p>

<p>On treating the ammonio-cupric solution of cellulose
with metallic zinc, this metal precipitates the copper, replacing
it in the solution, and producing the corresponding
ammonio-zincic solution of cellulose, which is colourless.
Some of these solutions are lævo-gyrate.</p>

<p>Cellulose, in those forms to which the application of the
term has been hitherto restricted, is a comparatively inert
substance, and its reactions are consequently few. One of
these is available for the identification of cellulose, and is
chiefly used in the microscopical examinations of tissues:
this is its reaction with iodine. Cellulose is not coloured
blue by a solution of iodine excepting under the simultaneous
influence of hydriodic acid, potassium iodide, sulphuric
acid, phosphoric acid, or zinc iodide or chloride. The
solution is prepared in the following way: zinc is dissolved
to saturation in hydrochloric acid, and the solution is evaporated
to sp. gr. 2·0; to 90 parts of this solution are added
6 parts potassium iodide dissolved in 10 parts of water; and
in this solution iodine is dissolved to saturation. By this
solution cellulose is coloured instantly a deep-blue or violet.
For the identification of cellulose in the gross, mere inspection
is usually sufficient; confirmatory evidence is afforded
by an observation of the action of the ammonio-copper
reagent, and of the absence of reaction with chlorine water.
(See p. <a href="#p018" title="go to p. 18">18</a>.)</p>

<p>Cellulose in its earlier stages of elaboration has no action
upon light; but with age it acquires the property of double
refraction, not, as has been shown by experiment, by virtue
of its state of aggregation, but of its molecular constitution
(Sachs). <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span></p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Animal Cellulose.</h3>—The
mantles of many of the mollusca,
e.g. the <i>Pyrosomidæ</i>, <i>Salpidæ</i>, and <i>Phallusia mammillaris</i>, contain
a resistant substance which, after isolation by chemical
treatment, has been found to be identical both in composition
and properties with vegetable cellulose. Cellulose has also
been stated to occur in degenerated human spleen and in
certain parts of the brain.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Compounds of Cellulose.</h3>—The
chemical inertness of cellulose
is a matter of everyday experience in the laboratory, where
it fulfils the important function of a filtering medium in the
greater number of separations of solids from liquids. Its
combinations with acids and with basic oxides are, as might
be expected, few and of little stability. It has been shown
by Mills that cellulose (cotton) in common with certain other
organic fibrous substances, when immersed in dilute solutions
of the acids or basic oxides, condenses these bodies
within itself at the expense of the surrounding solution,
which is proportionately weakened. This effect of concentration
is sufficiently uniform and constant to lead us to
assign it to a chemical cause, and the view is strengthened
by a consideration of the relative effects upon the various
acids and bases which have been investigated, and brought
to the following numerical expression:—Weight of cotton
3 grm. (with 6·9 per cent. H<sub>2</sub>O and 0·05 per cent. ash)—i.e.
2·893 anhydrous fibre. Strength of solution about 0·5 grm.
of the reagent in 250 cc.</div>

was observed for silk.</p>

<p>Cellulose removes barium hydrate from its solution in
wafer to form with it an insoluble compound. On adding
lead acetate to the solution of cellulose in the ammonio-copper
reagent, so prepared as to contain
no carbonate, a <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span>
precipitate is obtained consisting of a compound of cellulose
with lead oxide, but in variable proportions. The compound
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>PbO is formed by the action of finely-divided lead
oxide upon the above solution. Quite recently it has been
shown (O’Shea, <i>Chem. News</i>, May 28th, 1886) that when
dilute solutions of lead are passed through ordinary filter
paper, a certain amount is retained which cannot be removed
by washing.</p>

<p>Cellulose does not combine with metallic salts, a fact
which has been established incidentally to researches upon
the mode of action of mordants.</p>

<p>The combinations of cellulose with acid radicles (ethereal
salts) are both definite and stable.</p>

<p><i>Triacetyl Cellulose</i>
[C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>&#x202f;(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>&#x202f;O<sub>5</sub>]
is formed by treating
cellulose with six times its weight of acetic anhydride
at 180°&#x2005;C. (356°&#x2005;F.). The product of the reaction is a syrupy
solution from which the compound in question separates on
dilution with water as a white flocculent precipitate.</p>

<p>Triacetyl cellulose is insoluble in alcohol and in ether,
but soluble in glacial acetic acid. It is easily saponified
by boiling with a solution of potassium hydrate, the cellulose
being regenerated. No derivative containing more than
three acetyl groups has been obtained; but a mixture of the
mono-and di-acetyl cellulose is formed in treating cellulose
with only twice its weight of acetic anhydride, the formation
of these bodies being unattended by their solution.</p>

<p>Whenever cellulose, in any form, is brought into contact
with strong nitric acid at a low temperature, a nitro product,
or a nitrate, is formed. The extent of the nitration
depends upon the concentration of the acid, on the time of
contact of the cellulose with it, and on the state of the
physical division of the cellulose itself.</p>

<p>Knop, and also Kamarsch, and Heeren, found that a mixture
of sulphuric acid and nitric acid also formed nitrates of
cellulose; and still later (1847), Millon and Gaudin employed
a mixture of sulphuric acid and nitrates of soda or potash,
which they found to have
the same effect. <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span></p>

<p>Several well characterised nitrates have been formed, but
it is a very difficult matter to prepare any one in a state of
purity, and without admixture of a higher or lower nitrated
body.</p>

<p>The following are <span class="nowrap">known:—</span></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hexa-nitrate,
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>,<a
 class="afnancstar" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">&#x2a;</a>
gun cotton. In the formation
of this body, nitric acid of sp. gr. 1·5, and sulphuric acid
of sp. gr. 1·84 are mixed, in varying proportions, about 3
of nitric to 1 of sulphuric (sometimes this proportion is reversed),
and cotton is immersed in this at a temperature not
exceeding 10°&#x2005;C. (50°&#x2005;F.) for 24 hours: 100 parts of cellulose
yield about 175 of cellulose nitrate. The hexa-nitrate so
prepared is insoluble in alcohol, ether, or mixtures of both,
in glacial acetic acid or in methyl alcohol. Acetone dissolves
it very slowly. This is the most explosive gun-cotton. It
ignites at 160°–170°&#x2005;C. (320°–338°&#x2005;F.). According to
Eder the mixtures of nitre and sulphuric acid do not give
this nitrate. Ordinary gun cotton may contain as much as
12 per cent. of nitrates soluble in ether-alcohol. The hexa-nitrate
seems to be the only one quite insoluble in ether-alcohol.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc1" id="fn1">&#x2a;</a>
To represent the series of cellulose nitrates so as to avoid fractional
proportions, the ordinary empirical formula is doubled and the
nomenclature has reference to this double molecule.</p></div>
</li>

<li>
<p>Penta-nitrate, C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>15</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>.
This com­po­si­tion has been
very com­monly ascribed to gun-cotton. It is dif­fi­cult, if not
im­pos­sible, to prepare it in a state of purity by the direct
action of the acid on cellulose. The best method is the one
devised by Eder, making use of the property discovered by
de Vrij, that gun-cotton (hexa-nitrate) dissolves in nitric acid
at about 80°–90°&#x2005;C. (176°–194°&#x2005;F.) and is precipitated, as the
pentanitrate, by concentrated sulphuric acid after cooling
to 0°&#x2005;C. (32°&#x2005;F.); after mixing with a larger volume of
water, and washing the precipitate with water and then
with alcohol, it is dissolved in ether-alcohol, and again
precipitated with water, when it is obtained pure.</p>

<p>This nitrate is insoluble in alcohol, but
dissolves readily <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
in ether-alcohol, and slightly in acetic acid. Strong potash
solution converts this nitrate into the di-nitrate,
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>8</sub>&#x202f;(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The tetra-&#xa0;and tri-nitrates (collodion pyroxyline) are
generally formed together when cellulose is treated with a
more dilute nitric acid, and at a higher temperature, and for
a much shorter time (13 to 20 minutes), than in the formation
of the hexa-nitrate. It is not possible to separate them,
as they are soluble to the same extent in ether-alcohol,
acetic ether, acetic acid or wood spirit.</p>

<p>On treatment with concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids,
both the tri-and tetra-nitrates are converted into penta-nitrate
and hexa-nitrate. Potash and ammonia convert them into
di-nitrate.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Cellulose di-nitrate, C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>13</sub>O<sub>8</sub>&#x202f;(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> always results as the
final product of the action of alkalis on the other nitrates, and
also from the action of hot, somewhat dilute, nitric acid on
cellulose. The di-nitrate is very soluble in ether-alcohol,
acetic ether, and in absolute alcohol. Further action of alkalis
on the di-nitrate results in a complete de­comp­o­si­tion of the
molecule, some organic acids and tarry matters being formed.
The reactions and resolution products of this body have, however,
been but slightly studied, and apparently not at all with
the view to elucidate anything respecting the constitution of
cellulose itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Cellulose and Chlorine.</h3>—Dry
chlorine gas has no action
upon cellulose, but the presence of water determines an indirect
oxidising action. This oxidising action results from
the de­comp­o­si­tion of water by chlorine with formation of

these oxidised derivatives.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">2</a>
From their mode of formation,
they have been termed oxy­cel­lu­loses, and to distinguish them
from a series of more highly oxidised derivatives, produced
by the action of nitric acid upon cellulose, which they nevertheless
resemble in many of their characteristics, the prefix
α is employed. The following are the distinguishing features
of the α oxycelluloses as represented by the more extreme of
the above mentioned products. It reduces Fehling’s solution
at the boiling temperature, and the cuprous oxide is deposited
upon the fibre in a state of intimate union, producing the
effect of an orange dye. It attracts the basic colouring
matters from their solutions and is dyed to a full shade, the
depth of colour being proportionate to the amount of oxidation
to which the cellulose has been subjected. See also p.

Treated with a warm solution of phenylhydrazine salts
in water, it is coloured a bright lemon-yellow. Its most
remarkable property is its attraction for the vanadium compounds,
which is so powerful that combination may be proved

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Decomposition of
Cellulose.</h3>—<i>Acids.</i>—Of the de­comp­o­si­tion of cel­lu­lose
by artificial means, i.e. by the action of reagents, the most
important are those which disclose the relationship which it
bears to the group of so-called carbo-hydrates. Cellulose is,
indeed, a highly <i>elaborated</i> carbo-hydrate, differing from
dextrin and starch, not so much in its essential constitution
as in the molecular arrangement which has been impressed upon
it in and through the life of the plant. There are numerous
observations in biological science which demonstrate the close
connection, and in many cases the physiological equivalence
of the members of this natural group, which includes the
sugars, dextrin, starches, and cellulose. The following facts
show the constitutional or chemical ties which underlie their
interdependence.</div>

cotton is treated with 30 times its weight of sulphuric
acid somewhat diluted (1 part H<sub>2</sub>O, 4 parts
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) it quickly dissolves, the solution
being at first gelatinous, becoming afterwards syrupy. On
pouring this solution into water, a white flocculent precipitate
is formed, consisting of a substance closely resembling the
cellulose from which it is derived, differing, indeed, only in
being amorphous, and in being coloured blue by iodine. This
substance, from its resemblance to starch, has been called
<i>amyloid</i>. When sufficiently dehydrated it constitutes a swollen
starchy mass, which dries to a brittle transparent solid. This
transformation appears to consist in a simple hydration of the
cellulose molecule, <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></div>

<p class="pcontinue">The modification of cellulose, which occurs on
the conversion of unsized paper into the so-called parchment paper,
by exposure for a short time to the action of strong sulphuric acid,
and subsequent washing and drying, consists doubtless in a superficial
conversion of the cellulose into <i>amyloid</i>, or a body closely
resembling it.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Hydracellulose.</h3>—Closely
related in composition
to the above <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span>
described amyloid, is the substance called hydracellulose,
into which cellulose is converted by exposure for some time
to the action of moderately strong sulphuric, or hydrochloric
acids (sp. gr. 1·35). This substance is also formed by the
action of very weak acids, if the exposure of the cellulose
be sufficiently prolonged. Its formation is accompanied by
the complete disintegration of the cellulose. If the action of
strong sulphuric acid be prolonged, a further modification
ensues, dextrin or sugar being formed. These products
have not been sufficiently studied to have established their
exact identity with any of the substances known under these
group-names. The dextrin has a close resemblance to the
dextrin obtained from starch; the sugar is susceptible of
fermentation; but beyond this nothing specific is known of
these bodies. Their general properties, however, and mode
of formation, sufficiently establish the fact that cellulose itself
is constituted of similar molecules.</div>

<p>The action of zinc chloride solution upon cellulose is similar
to that of sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Cellulose in contact with iron, and in presence of air and
moisture, is converted into a sugar and a gummy substance,
which latter is converted into a sugar on boiling with dilute
acids. Oxidised by potassium permanganate or bichromate
in presence of acetic acid, it is converted into glucose, dextrin,
and formic acid.</p>

digesting cellulose with nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·3) at 100°&#x2005;C. (212°&#x2005;F.),
a considerable quantity of oxalic acid is formed; but after
prolonged digestion, a residue remains, which yields but
very slowly to the action of the acid. This substance, which
is white and flocculent, when thrown upon a filter and
washed with water, combines with the latter to form a
gelatinous hydrate. It dissolves in dilute alkalis, but without
forming a stable compound with the base. It usually
amounts to about 30 per cent. of the cellulose acted upon.
Its elementary composition is expressed
by the formula <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>26</sub>O<sub>16</sub> (C = 43·4, H = 5·3 per cent.). Treated with a mixture

essential properties therefore β oxycellulose exhibits a close

from the members of the cellulose group by dissolving

a pink colour. It appears to stand in very close relationship
to the group of pectic substances, which are oxidised derivatives
of cellulose.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Alkalis.</h3>—Concentrated
solutions of the caustic alkalis in
the cold attack and disintegrate cellulose but slowly. The
action is in many cases merely superficial. Dilute solutions
of the alkalis are without action upon cellulose even at the
boiling temperature, unless the condition of oxidation is
super-added; in this case, acid bodies are found. The extreme
product of the oxidation of cellulose in presence of the caustic
alkalis is oxalic acid; this acid has indeed been prepared on
the commercial scale by the “fusion” of cellulosic substances,
with mixture of sodium and potassium hydrates. Malic acid
has been obtained as an intermediate product of this decomposition.
By potassium permanganate in presence of potassium
hydrate, both in solution, finely divided cellulose is
oxidised to a syrupy mixture of acids resembling in composition
and properties Frémy’s meta-pectic acid. A similar
decomposition is effected by concentrated solutions of the
hypochlorites, employed cold.</div>

this aromatic substance from cellulose is, perhaps, the most
noticeable feature of the decomposition.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Decomposition by means of ferments, &#x26;c.</h3>—The
soluble ferment
of the foxglove has been found to convert cellulose into
glucose and dextrin. The fluid from the vermiform appendix
of the rabbit has also been found to digest cellulose with
liberation of marsh gas and formation of a soluble compound
which reduces cupric oxide in alkaline solution.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Humus.</h3>—In
the natural decay of cellulosic structures a
large quantity of marsh gas is formed, and solid products are
formed, which are usually known as humic or ulmic substances.
These bodies are amorphous, are largely dissolved
by alkaline solutions, and are attacked by chlorine gas in
presence of moisture, yielding yellow coloured chlorinated
derivatives whose composition has a general resemblance to
the chlorinated compounds obtained from the compound
celluloses, to be hereafter described.</div>

<p>The most important part which ulmic substances play in
the economy of nature, is in the composition of soils. It is
doubtful whether they act directly as fertilisers, but by their
action upon the mineral constituents of soils they contribute
to the supply of these necessary elements of growth to the
plant.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Synthesis of Cellulose.</h3>—A
transformation of certain soluble
carbo-hydrates into cellulose, which may be regarded as a
proximate synthesis of cellulose, has recently been brought to
light. This is set up spontaneously in beet-juice, and results
in the formation of a hard white substance, insoluble in boiling
dilute potash, soluble in the ammonio-copper reagent,
converted by sulphuric acid into dextrin and sugar, and by
nitric acid into oxalic acid. On adding some of these cellulose
lumps to a solution of pure cane-sugar, a further transformation
of the saccharose into the same substance is
brought about. At the same time there is simultaneously
produced a gummy substance, which
is precipitated by <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
alcohol as a white amorphous caoutchouc-like mass, of the
same composition as cellulose, but swelling up with water,
and otherwise differing in its physical properties from cellulose.
This latter substance is also formed by the action of
diastaste upon a solution of saccharose.</div>

<p>The process of cellulosic fermentation may be represented
by the equation:</p>

<p class="pcontinue">A similar transformation takes place under the influence of
certain fatty seeds, e. g. those of rape and colza; and it is
probable that the formation of cellulose in living plants may
take place at the expense of saccharose and under the influence
of ferments. In support of this it has been established
that in the sugar-cane, the formation of wood—i.e. cellulose—is
accompanied <i>pari passu</i> by a decrease in saccharose. More
recently, A. Brown (<i>Chem. Soc. Journ.</i>, 432, 1886) has
investigated the formation of cellulose by the “vinegar
plant” growing in solutions of the carbo-hydrates, e. g. dextrose
in yeast-water. The cells elaborate an extra-cellular
fibrin, which acts as a “cell-collecting medium,” and they
possess therefore a two-sided activity, i.e. the property above
mentioned, in addition to their strictly fermentative activity.
The cellulose film in question was found to contain 50 to 60
per cent. of pure cellulose. It is noteworthy that in a solution
of levulose the growth of the “plant” is unattended by
fermentative action, 33 per cent. of the substance being, on
the other hand, transformed into cellulose.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Modifications
of Cellulose in the Plant. Compound Celluloses.</h3>—It
has been already stated that cellulose occurs in nature
for the most part in a form different from that in which we
have hitherto considered it, viz. either combined or mixed
with other substances which are of such a nature that they
may be removed by a chemical process, more or less simple.
One of the most characteristic of these modified celluloses constitutes
the jute fibre, the isolated bast of
an Indian plant, <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span>
which has an enormous industrial application for the coarser
textile purposes. The chemistry of jute throws light on the
course of lignification, the process by which cellulose is
modified into wood, and in studying it in preference to wood
we have the advantage of studying a simple tissue.</div>

<p>Like cellulose, jute dissolves in cuprammonia, and is
similarly acted upon by the concentrated acids. By nitric
acids it is converted into nitric ethers, which are yellow
coloured, but in other respects closely resemble the pyroxylins.
They are entirely soluble in acetone.</p>

<p class="pcontinue">It is harsher to the touch, and its colour varies from grey to
brown; it combines directly with the greater number of the
organic colouring matters, removing them from solution, i.e.,
becoming dyed with them; it is coloured deep yellow by
immersion in a solution of aniline sulphate; moistened with
a solution of phloroglucol and afterwards with hydrochloric
acid, it gives a deep red coloration; with pyrrol also in
presence of hydrochloric acid it gives a deep carmine colour;
it is attacked and partially converted into soluble products
by a number of reagents which have no action, under similar
conditions, upon cellulose. Certain of these we must consider
more in detail.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Iodine.</h3>—Jute
absorbs iodine from its solution in potassium
iodide. This action is characteristic of all lignified tissues,
the quantity of iodine taken up being proportional to the
amount of lignification. If the physical conditions remain
the same, the amounts of iodine absorbed will be found to be
constant for each particular fibre. This constancy points to
the formation of a definite chemical compound, probably resembling
the blue compound of starch and iodine. This
property may be made available for the
estimation of the <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span>
amount of mechanical wood-pulp in papers; it will be more
fully considered elsewhere.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Bromine.</h3>—Jute,
exposed to the action of bromine water in
the cold, combines with the halogen, being oxidised at the
same time, and the products may be dissolved by boiling the
modified fibre in weak alkaline solutions. On repeating this
treatment four or five times, a residue of cellulose is ultimately
obtained, amounting to 72 or 73 per cent. of the original
fibre: the cellulose is obtained in the form of the disintegrated
fibre elements. On allowing the halogen to act in
presence of an alkali, <i>i.e.</i>, as hypobromite, not only is its
action intensified and accelerated, but its <i>modus operandi</i>
more clearly revealed. The chief products are in this case,
carbonic acid, bromoform CHBr<sub>3</sub> (which may be isolated by
distillation), and cellulose. At the same time the yield of
cellulose is considerably less than by the former method, the
cellulose itself being attacked by the hypobromite.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Chlorine.</h3>—Dry
chlorine gas has no action upon jute even
when the temperature is raised to 140°&#x2005;C. (284°&#x2005;F.), but the
presence of moisture determines rapid combination, at ordinary
temperature, accompanied by evolution of heat. The
colour of the jute changes to a bright yellow, which, on
treatment of the fibre with a solution of sodium sulphite,
gives place to a pure magenta. This reaction is characteristic
of all lignified tissues, and is a valuable aid in the micro-chemical
examination of plant structures. For this purpose,
the reagent may be employed in the form of chlorine water;
the sections or small fragments to be examined are allowed
to remain in this solution a short time, and then mounted for
observation in a dilute solution of sodium sulphite. By
combination with chlorine the fibre substance or <i>ligno-cellulose</i>
is partially resolved. Alcohol dissolves away from the
chlorinated fibre, a bright yellow substance, which is precipitated
in yellow flocks on pouring the solution into water.
This chlorinated derivative has the composition C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>18</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub>.
By this formula, as well as by its colour reactions, and by
its yielding protocatechuic acid on fusion with
potash, it is <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span>
shown to be related to the trihydric phenols, and to the
tannins which are derivatives of these.</div>

<p>After dissolving away this compound by exhaustive
treatment with alcohol, the fibre still gives a brilliant
reaction with sodium sulphite, showing that a portion
is still held back in combination with the cellulose,
or cellulose residue. On treating the residual fibre
with boiling nitric acid, a considerable quantity of
chloropicrin CCl<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> is formed,
and it is probable that the union of the molecule
C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>18</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub>
with the cellulose may be effected by the aldehyde<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn5" id="fnanc5">5</a> molecule
CCl<sub>3</sub>COH; each group being contained in the
original lignocellulose, the action of the chlorine tending
to disturb the atomic equilibrium and to rearrange the
atoms into groups, which in their modified form have less
mutual coherence. If the chlorinated fibre be directly
boiled with the sodium sulphite solution, its resolution
into cellulose and soluble non-cellulose derivatives is
complete: and this treatment constitutes the most simple
and rapid method of estimating the cellulose in lignified
tissues. It is only necessary finally to wash the cellulose
with hot water containing a little acetic acid (when placed
in a funnel it acts as its own filter), and then with,
alcohol, when it may be dried and weighed. In order to
ensure the resolution of the fibre by a single chlorination
(in the case of jute, and the like), it must, previously to
exposure to the gas, be boiled in a dilute (1 per cent.)
solution of potassic hydrate. In the case of wood and other
more resistant structures, it will be necessary to repeat
the chlorination.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc5" id="fn5">5</a>
Furfural may also be isolated from the chlorinated jute; the survival
of this aldehyde is noteworthy.</p></div>

<p>The percentage of cellulose yielded by this method is, in
the case of jute, usually 2–3 per cent. higher than by the
bromine method. Moreover, if the temperature be maintained
at 0°&#x2005;C. (32°&#x2005;F.), by placing the fibre, which is to be
exposed to the action of the gas, in contact with pounded
ice, the percentage may be still
further increased, amounting <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
in some cases to 80–82. Corresponding to this increased
yield, the cellulose is obtained in long filaments. It will
be seen, therefore, that the cellulose isolated by chemical
treatment from a <i>compound cellulose</i> is affected both in
character and quantity by the process employed, and it is
affected in a much greater degree than the cellulose itself
exposed to the same treatment, <i>after isolation</i>. The composition
of the cellulose obtained in this way differs from that of
celluloses, such as cotton, which exist in the plant in an isolated
and more fully formed condition; it contains 43 per cent. C and
6 per cent. H, corresponding to the formula
n [3&#x200a;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O.]
The composition of this cellulose will be seen to be identical
with that of certain of the oxycelluloses previously described;
and its properties are, moreover, those of an oxycellulose.
These facts go to show that the jute fibre substance, and
the substances allied to it, are compounds of cellulose with
other molecules, <i>i.e.</i> they are <i>compound celluloses</i>. They may
be conveniently grouped under the term <i>ligno-cellulose</i>.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Dilute Mineral Acids.</h3>—Under
the action of dilute sulphuric
or hydrochloric acid (5–10 per cent.) at 60°–80°&#x2005;C. (140°–176°
F.), a considerable portion of the fibre substance is dissolved.
The action of either reagent is of course purely hydrolytic;
and the hydrolysis is of the simplest character, since the
substance dissolved as well as the residual fibre are found to
have the same percentage composition. Moreover, the
residual fibre, though having undergone a profound structural
modification, and having been converted into a disintegrated
mass of brittle fragments, still preserves the chemical characteristics
of the original, unaltered. Thus it is converted by
the action of chlorine into a similar complex of derivatives,
yielding on resolution by sodium sulphite solution 75 per cent.
of cellulose; also when acted upon by alkaline hypobromite it
yields bromoform. Under the action of these hydrolytic
reagents, therefore, the fibre shows itself to be essentially a
chemical whole. At the boiling temperature, these acids
resolve as well as dissolve the fibre substance, and the
volatile products are acetic acid and
the peculiar aldehyde <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
<i>furfural</i>
C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O.COH. The yield of this aldehyde may be
raised with suitable precautions to 15–20 per cent. of the
raw fibre. The action of dilute nitric acid upon the fibre
differs from that of the above-mentioned acids, in effecting
its resolution into soluble derivatives and insoluble cellulose;
the yield of the latter when the reaction is conducted at
60°&#x2005;C. (140°&#x2005;F.), with 5 parts HNO<sub>3</sub> is 60 per cent. only, showing
that in the process of isolation some of the cellulose
itself is attacked and converted into soluble products.</div>

<p>Schulze’s method of isolating cellulose from
wood, and from the ligno-celluloses generally,
consisted in macerating them for 12 to 14 days with
<sup>8</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>10</sub> their weight
of potassium chlorate dissolved in 12 parts by weight
of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·10), and completing the
resolution by afterwards boiling with dilute ammonia.
By the action of a more concentrated acid, 50 per cent.
HNO<sub>3</sub>, at 80°&#x2005;C. (176°&#x2005;F.), a
soluble derivative is obtained which has the composition
<span class="nowrap">
(C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>40</sub>NO<sub>25</sub>).</span>
It is a syrupy, highly acid body, dyeing
animal fibres a deep yellow shade, and giving
with the earthy bases salts of the formula
<span class="nowrap">
(C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>32</sub>NO<sub>25</sub>M<sub>4</sub>),</span>
which are precipitated by alcohol from their aqueous
solution in the form of bright yellow flocks that dry to a
yellow powder.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Dilute Alkalis.</h3>—The
action of boiling dilute solutions of the
caustic alkalis upon the ligno-celluloses is similar to that of
the dilute acids, viz., purely hydrolytic, causing no essential
change in the composition of the fibre substance.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Water at High Temperatures.</h3>—The
ligno-celluloses undergo
a profound modification when heated with water at elevated
temperatures. They are to a great extent converted into
soluble products, of which a large proportion are the volatile
bodies, acetic and formic acids and furfural. The residual
fibre is found to be more or less disintegrated, and of a dark-brown
colour, but preserving many of the chemical features
of the original. A similar disintegration is caused by exposing
the ligno-celluloses in a dry state to an atmosphere
of superheated steam, the effect being much increased if the
ligno-cellulose be previously bleached by any
of the ordinary <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
processes, i.e., under oxidising conditions. In these decompositions
oxidation, as well as hydration, plays an important
part. It is found that the presence of small quantities of
reducing agents, e.g., sulphites, exerts a remarkable effect
in retarding and often entirely preventing these changes.
It is probable that they act in obviating an initial change,
which, with a cumulative reaction on the fibre, effects the
profound resolutions above described. (See p.
<a href="#p071" title="go to p. 71">71</a>.)</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Concentrated Hydrochloric Acid.</h3>—When
exposed to the
concentrated aqueous acid at ordinary temperatures, ligno-cellulose
undergoes a profound structural modification,
and is largely converted into soluble bodies. The disintegrated
residue reacts with chlorine similarly to the original
jute, but the quantity of cellulose isolated by subsequent
treatment with alkaline solutions is only 50 per cent. of the
original. Since jute cellulose, after isolation, exhibits under
similar treatment a much smaller conversion into soluble
products, 10 per cent. as compared with 33, we have here
further evidence that the cellulose is present in the fibre in a
condition chemically different from that of the isolated

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Sulphuric Acid.</h3>—On
triturating the fibre with the concentrated
acid, it dissolves to a brownish-purple solution; on
pouring this solution into water, a substance is precipitated
in dark-brown flocks; when dried it has the following

<p class="pcontinue">The

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Nitric and
Sulphuric Acids.</h3>—(1&#x202f;:&#x202f;2 by vol.)—By the
action of these acids ligno-cellulose is converted into
yellow-coloured ex­plos­ive com­pounds, preserving all the
external features of the original fibre, and showing a
close resemblance to the pyroxylins.</div>

<p>The increase in weight resulting from the
fixation of the <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
nitric acid residue is approximately equal to that of cotton
“nitrated” under the same conditions.</p>

<p>They are freely soluble in acetone. On examination they
prove to be homogeneous. If the fibre be warmed with the
mixture after the first reaction is completed, it dissolves.
The solution is found to contain oxalic, succinic, and suberic
acids, but no aromatic nitro-derivatives, whereas if ligno-cellulose
contain a benzene nucleus, as has been supposed,
such derivatives could not fail to be formed under these
conditions.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Animal Digestion of Ligno-cellulose.</h3>—It
has long been known
that the urine of herbivorous animals contains hippuric acid,
or benzoyl glycocine, as a normal constituent, and it has been
shown that the benzoyl radicle necessary to form this body
by reacting with the glycocine of the liver, is a product of
the digestion of ligno-cellulose. On the other hand, it has
been shown that ligno-cellulose contains no benzene compounds
as such. We have therefore, in this fact additional evidence
that a portion of the complex ligno-cellulose molecule is in
what we may term a potentially aromatic condition.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Distribution of Ligno-celluloses.</h3>—As
already indicated, the
distribution of the ligno-celluloses is extremely wide; they
are met with in every variety of vegetable tissue, and their
presence is readily ascertained by the reaction of chlorination
already described. Of these ligno-celluloses most closely
allied to jute, we may mention the stony concretions of pears
(glycodrupose) and the main tissue of fir wood (glycolignose).</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Decay of Ligno-cellulose.</h3>—When
a mass of ligno-cellulose
(jute) is allowed to lie for a long period in a damp state, it
undergoes resolution accompanied by structural disintegration.
The soluble products of this change are acid bodies of
the pectic class, and astringent substances closely resembling
the tannins. In this decomposition also we have evidence
of the plastic condition of the ligno-cellulose molecule, of the
variety of its modes of resolution, according to the various
directions in which it is attacked.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Decomposition by Heat.</h3>—The
celluloses burn in
the air with <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
a quiet luminous flame. When heated out of contact with
the air, they are completely resolved into gaseous and volatile
products on the one hand, and a residual black mass, which,
although containing a high percentage of carbon, and approximating
in its properties to the element itself, nevertheless
contains hydrogen and oxygen in essential chemical union
with the carbon, in consequence of which it is expedient to
apply the term pseudo-carbon to this as to all similar substances.
The volatile products of the destructive distillation
of pure cellulose have not been studied, but those of certain
of the ligno-celluloses (woods) have been exhaustively investigated,
and have moreover, a very considerable commercial
importance. They divide themselves into two groups (<i>a</i>)
soluble in water, and containing, besides water, acetic acid,
methyl alcohol, methylic acetate and acetone; (<i>b</i>) insoluble
in water, or wood tar, containing tolyene, xylene, cymene,
naphthalene, chrysene, anthracene, retene, pittacal, cedriret
solid paraffins, &#x26;c. The quantity of the pseudo-carbon
(charcoal) obtained is, in the case of the hard woods, about
25 per cent. of their weight. The liquid portion of the products
amount to some 50 per cent., and contains about one-fifth
of the carbon of the original wood; the remainder of the
carbon is eliminated in the gaseous form (CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, &#x26;c.).
The proportion of acetic acid is 3–4 per cent., the tar amounting
to 7–8 per cent.</div>

<p>The coals themselves may be regarded as pseudo-carbon
derivatives of celluloses, formed by a process of molecular
condensation, the true nature of which remains a matter of
speculation. In this view, the whole of our vast series of
aromatic or benzene compounds, derived as they are from the
products of the destructive distillation of coals, may be traced
back to a cellulose origin.</p>

<p>Pseudo-carbons are obtained as products of the action of
various reagents upon the celluloses, and other of the so-called
carbo-hydrates. These reagents, such as sulphuric acid, act
in virtue of their dehydrating power; and the recognition
of this fact, together with
the supposed “carbonaceous” <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
character of the product, led to the erroneous conclusion that
the carbohydrates are in such decompositions simply resolved
into carbon and water; a conclusion which seems to derive
additional warrant from the peculiar numerical relationship
which exists between the C, H, O atoms of all the members
of the group. Their relation is expressed in the general
formula <span class="nowrap">
C<sub>n</sub> H<sub>2(n−m)</sub> O<sub>(n−m)</sub>,</span> and in the somewhat misleading
term carbohydrate, which is applied to the whole group. We
now know that the removal of water from these bodies by
the action of dehydrating agents—including heat—follows
the ascertained laws of chemical dehydration, involving
molecular con­den­sa­tions and rear­range­ment, and that the
pseudo-carbons are the extreme terms of a series of such
con­den­sa­tions or cum­u­la­tive res­o­lu­tions. The matter, however,
is not as yet sufficiently investigated to enable us to
state with any preciseness the mechanism of these changes.
Still this general statement will enable us to avoid many of
the erroneous views which have existed on the subject, and
in a measure to anticipate the results of future
investigation.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn6" id="fnanc6">6</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc6" id="fn6">6</a>
It is worthy of mention that by the action of chlorine in presence of
water, and by the action of concentrated nitric acid upon the cannel coals,
substitution derivatives are formed resembling those obtained by the action
of these reagents respectively upon the ligno-celluloses.</p></div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">General conclusions.</h3>—The
aldehydic character of the group
of ligno-celluloses is typical of the constituents of plant tissues
generally, and is, there can be no doubt, extended to the
celluloses. Indeed the evidence of biological observation
goes to show that the ligno-celluloses are formed, by a process
of chemical modification, from some more purely cellulosic
tissue, which preceded it, and with this modification there is,
nevertheless, a retention of the general features of the original
cellulose. In the domain of animal chemistry, recent investigation
has also shown that the development of proteid
tissues finds its chemical expression in their aldehydic characteristics,
or as it has been put, the immediate physical
cause of life is to be found in the <i>chemical tension</i> of aldehydes.
The meaning of this expression will be
readily grasped on <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
reference to the properties of the aldehydes as a group; their
power of combining with oxygen; of uniting by their own
molecules, to polymerise; of uniting by way of dehydration;
of combining with the aromatic alcohols; a consensus of
properties which shows them to possess an activity surpassing
that of any other group of compounds. The evidence of
biology, added to our knowledge of the properties of these
substances, would lead us therefore to define cellulose as a
condensed aldehyde allied to the sugars, and likewise containing
alcoholic OH groups; and ligno-cellulose a compound
cellulose, containing a cellulose nucleus or residue so combined
with certain groups which may be included in the term <i>non-cellulose</i>,
that it yields, under the action of reagents, products
belonging either to the aromatic, the furfural, or the fatty
group.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Adipo-cellulose.</h3>—Cork
or Cuticular Tissue.—From the mode
of formation of cork and cuticular tissues, it has been concluded
that they are also modified celluloses. The aggregate ultimate
composition of cork is represented by the following percentage
numbers:</div>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="dtblcntr">

 <td class="tdcntr">24·5</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">N</td>
 <td class="tdcntr">&#x2007;1·5</td></tr>
</table></div>
</div><!--dtablebox-->

<p class="pcontinue">Cork, however, unlike the jute fibre, is by no means chemically
simple, but can be resolved by the action of mere
solvents into a number of proximate constituents, such as
acids, a variety of fatty bodies, nitrogeneous bodies, &#x26;c.</p>

<p>Cuticular tissues, such as constitute the covering of fruits,
are more simple in composition; the cuticle of the apple after
purification, has the following percentage composition:</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="dtblcntr">
<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">C</td>
 <td class="tdcntr">73·66</td></tr>

 <td class="tdcntr">11·37</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">O</td>
 <td class="tdcntr">14·97</td></tr>
</table></div>
</div><!--dtablebox-->

<p class="pcontinue">The cuticular substance of cotton, straw, esparto, &#x26;c., are
doubtless similar bodies. These numbers
point to a <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
remarkable similarity in composition to the fats, and, indeed, from
the results of his study of this tissue, Frémy concluded
that it was a fat in everything but its physical properties,
of which we may mention insolubility in alcohol and
in ether, and infusibility. This tissue, however, as also
cork, contains a cellulose residue, which may be isolated
by any of the methods of treatment given for ligno-cellulose.
Under the action of boiling nitric acid these tissues
are resolved into cellulose on the one hand, and a series
of fatty acids or products of their decomposition, suberic
and adipic acids, &#x26;c., on the other; the latter amounting in
the case of cork to 40 per cent. of the weight of the substance
treated. The cellulose obtained by this treatment is but 2–3
per cent.; this number, however, represents only the amount
which has survived a treatment which we know to be
destructive to cellulose. If, on the other hand, cork be resolved
by treatment with sodium sulphite solution at 100lb.
pressure, or 166°&#x2005;C. (331°&#x2005;F.), a soft mass is obtained, preserving
the structural features of the original cork, until
subjected to slight pressure, when it falls to a cellular mass.
From this, cellulose is isolated by any of the less drastic
processes above described, and is found to amount to
9–10% of the original cork. As in ligno-cellulose, we have
evidence of a transition from cellulose to the tannins, so
in cork and cuticular tissue we have evidence of the metamorphosis
of cellulose into fats, a fact indicated in the term
<i>adipo-cellulose</i>, which we have applied to the compound
celluloses constituting these protective plant tissues. This
metamorphosis is doubtless a very complex process, and
would appear to involve the formation of tannins also, at
least as a subsidiary result. Still, the essential feature of the
change is the production of the peculiar fat-like substances
which have been described; and with due regard to the
limitation pointed out, the views here advanced represent the
results of the investigations of the subject as far as they have
proceeded.</p>

<p>It may be observed that the general
characteristics of the <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
adipo-celluloses as of the ligno-celluloses are those of a
complex aldehyde.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Pecto-Cellulose.</h3>—The
compound cellulose described under
the names adipo-cellulose and ligno-cellulose have this feature
in common, that they are richer in carbon than cellulose.
On the other hand there is a large number of cellulosic
tissues which contain in the aggregate less carbon, i.e., in
which the cellulose is combined or mixed with substances
of lower carbon percentage than itself. Such tissues, or
rather the substances which compose them, are resolved by
simple treatment with dilute alkaline solutions into insoluble
cellulose, and soluble bodies of the pectic class. Thus the
purified bast of the Russian flax, i.e., the raw flax, is found to
<span class="nowrap">contain—</span></div>

<p class="pcontinue">On boiling with an alkali it loses in weight about 20 per
cent., the substance dissolved being identical in properties
with Frémy’s pectic acid, a substance containing 42 per cent.
C and 4.8 per cent. H = C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>15</sub>. Many other bast fibres,
as well as cellulose tissues, exhibit similar properties, and
although this branch of the subject has been but little investigated,
there is sufficient evidence for constituting a
special class of compound celluloses under this term, pecto-cellulose,
having properties indicated in the type selected
above.</p>

<p>In addition to pectic acid there exists in, or can readily
be obtained from certain plants, a series of bodies of a similar
nature, such as pectose, pectin, parapectic acid and metapectic
acid. The most important of these are pectic acid and metapectic
acid.</p>

<p>Pectic acid, though it rarely exists ready-formed in the
plant, can readily be obtained from it by the action of weak
alkalis. It is best procured by boiling the pulp of turnips
with a 10 per cent. solution of sodium carbonate for about
half an hour. If an acid be added to the filtered liquid, pectic
acid is precipitated as a transparent
colourless jelly, which <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
dries up to a transparent horny mass. By the prolonged
action of alkalis or acids, pectic acid is converted into metapectic
acid (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>9</sub>), which may be obtained as a syrupy,
strongly acid liquid.</p>

<p>From what we know of the properties of the members of
the pectic group, and therefore of the pecto-celluloses, it
will be readily seen that the latter are very liable under
the action of alkalis to undergo conversion into soluble
derivatives.</p>

<p>Conversely, a study of the action of alkalis upon plant substances,
enables us to determine to what extent the latter
partake of the nature of the pecto-cellulose, the importance
of which to the practical paper maker we need hardly point
out. For a further development of this idea (see

CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3 class="h3afterh2">PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF FIBRES.</h3>

<p class="pfirst">We
now have to treat of the fibrous raw materials from
the point of view of form or structure, which is, of course, a
very important factor in determining the quality of the paper
or other fabric into which they are manufactured. It is
sufficiently evident that the strength of paper is primarily
due to the cohesion of its constituent fibres. When paper is
torn, the edges present a fibrous appearance, and observation
teaches us that, other things being equal, the greater the
manifestation of fibrous structure the stronger will be the
paper. If a paper be thoroughly wetted, its tensile strength
is reduced to a minimum, and if subjected to a slight strain
we get, not a tearing, but a pulling asunder of the fibres.
If this be performed under a lens, the structure of the paper
is more clearly seen, and it will be appreciated to what
extent the qualities of a paper are the aggregate of the
qualities of its constituent fibres. A more careful dissection
of the paper shows that these fibres, which are the <i>ultimate
fibres</i> of the plant, as distinguished from the bundles of these,
or <i>filaments</i>, which the spinner employs, are interlaced in all
directions. To produce this effect of interweaving, and to
insure that uniformity which is an essential feature of good
paper, we have among others the following contributory
causes: (1) the deposition of the fibres from suspension in
water; (2) the composition of the pulp with regard to the
reduction of the fibrous bundles, and the isolation of the
individual fibres; and (3) the <i>structure</i> of these ultimate
fibres. It is with the last that we are chiefly concerned at
present.</p>

<p>To convey a general notion of the influence
of the structure <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
of fibres upon fabrics, we shall with advantage travel outside
our immediate province to consider briefly the woollen and
silk manufactures in relation to this point. Wool is, as we
know, a discontinuous fibre, and its structure is that represented
in Fig. 1, the most conspicuous feature being its
broken surface, consisting apparently of imbricated
scales.</p>

<div class="dfloatright dwth-j">
<img src="images/i031.png" width="179" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
1.</div>
</div>

<p>The silk fibre, on the other hand, is a dual
cylinder, spun by the worm in a continuous
length, and with a perfectly smooth surface.
Now, it would not be to our purpose to point
out that in starting from a discontinuous
simple fibre, to produce a continuous, therefore
necessarily compound one, a very different
treatment or process of spinning is required
from that which the opposite condition renders
practicable. We will rather consider the influence
of structure upon materials manufactured
from these fibres. It is obvious that
the wool fibres, brought into contact with one
another, tend to interlock; whereas silk fibres
if rubbed or pressed together, simply slide
over one another; the result in the fabric is
by multiplication of the effect, a shrinking or
contracting in length and breadth. This
interaction of the fibres, and the phenomena to
which it gives rise, is known as the <i>felting</i> of
wool and woollen goods; this tendency, for
the contrary reason, is not seen in silk fabrics.
The production of paper from a disintegrated
fibrous mass or pulp introduces similar considerations. That
paper will be the stronger in which the constituent fibres are
the better felted, and the degree in which felting takes place
will depend to a great extent upon the form or microscopic
peculiarities of the fibres. This is only one of the more
obvious inferences to be drawn from the structure of fibres
to the qualities of the papers which
they compose. Other <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span>
equally important practical bearings will be seen to attach
to the microscopic study of our fibrous raw materials, and
to the consideration of this branch of the subject, we now
ask the careful attention of the student.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlinebold">Microscopical
 Examination.</h3>—Under the head of
“Microscopic Features” we must include everything which
has to do with the structure of the vegetable fibres, as well as
their organisation and distribution in the plant. In the analysis
of “organised” structures we employ the two methods.
(1) of <i>dissection</i>; (2) <i>examination</i> by means of the microscope;
in other words, we first isolate the part under investigation
by a mechanical process and then proceed to the optical
resolution or analysis of the part. Having by analysis
acquired a knowledge of the <i>parts</i>, we study their mutual
relations in the structure they compose—we integrate our
knowledge, so to speak—by means of sections of the structure,
cut so as to preserve the cohesion of the parts in section, and
yet in so fine a film as to appear under the microscope to be
virtually a plane surface. These points are illustrated in the
drawings given.</div>

<p>It is impossible for us to deal specially with the subject of
the microscope and its manipulation. The microscope, as a
revealer of natural wonders is one thing; as an instrument of
scientific discovery, quite another. For the latter, the student
must train himself by systematic work, and should especially
concentrate his attention upon some <i>one</i> branch of natural
history, however restricted.</p>

<p>We shall assume, in our treatment of the subject, a knowledge
of the microscope as an instrument of research, such as can
be easily acquired in a few weeks of work under the guidance
of a teacher or of one of the excellent manuals which now
abound. We also assume a certain acquaintance with the
elements of vegetable physiology, which it will be seen is
necessary for a full grasp of the subject. Such an acquaintance,
also, may be easily acquired, under direction, in a few weeks
of work.</p>

<div class="dctr01">

<p>We have before alluded to the
differences presented by <span class="xxpn" id="p033">{33}</span>
mono and di­cot­y­le­don­ous stems in regard to the distribution
of their fibrous constituents. In illustration of this, we may
cite Figs. 2, 3, which represent, (2) a section of the aloe,
(3) a section of the jute plant. The available fibres are in
(2) the fibro-vascular bundles (<i>f</i>), which are irregularly
distributed throughout the main mass of
cellular tissue, and <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
in (3) the bast fibres (<i>f</i>), which constitute a definite and
separate tissue. We have already alluded to the practical
consequences of this typical difference of distribution, in
regard to processes of separating these fibres on the large
scale.</p>

<p>This process we have explained is necessarily simpler in
the case of a fibrous <i>tissue</i>, definitely localised; and this may
be demonstrated by a superficial examination of a young
branch of an exogen. As we know, the bark tissues are
easily stripped from the underlying wood. If now we
work up the former in a mortar, with a little water, we soon
perceive the separation of the compound tissue into cellular
matter on the one hand and <i>fibres</i>, the latter being more or
less long and silky, according to the plant from which
isolated. They vary in length from one millimetre to several
centimetres, and are aggregated together in the plant in such
a way as to constitute bundles, often of very considerable
length; the general arrangement being comparable with
that of the tiles in the roof of a house. It is important to
distinguish the fibre-bundles from the elementary or normal
<i>fibres</i>, and to this end they are designated by the term <i>filament</i>.
Bast <i>fibres</i> are flexible and fusiform, terminating gradually
in a point at either end, as represented in Fig. 4; bast
<i>filaments</i>, built up of these fibres, containing often as many
as twelve in the bundle, are usually cylindrical, but exhibit
the widest differences in regard to the aggregation,
in degree as well as number of their constituents. It is
obvious that while the spinner has to do with these <i>filaments</i>,
the paper maker works up the ultimate fibre constituents or
<i>fibres</i>. It is also an obvious corollary from this distinction
that a fibrous material which from “weakness” is unavailable
for textile application, may yet be perfectly “strong” from
the paper maker’s point of view; in other words, the individual
fibres may be strong, but have little cohesion in the filaments.
As we proceed, the student will see more and more the
practical bearings of this branch of the study, and will perceive
the inferences to be drawn from
the investigation of <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
minute relationships to manufacturing processes and their
products.</p>

<p>We shall say but little as to the necessary equipment.
(1) A dissecting microscope, for dissecting under a lens,
magnifying the object to 40 or 50 diameters. (2) An ordinary
student’s microscope with lenses for magnifying to 100 and
300 diameters. This is adequate to the work, though of
course, it may be an advantage in certain cases, to be provided
with higher powers. (3) A glass slide, carrying an
engraved scale of centimetres and millimetres for measuring
the lengths of objects, and a micrometer, divided into
<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>10</sub> mm.
for measuring diameters. It is also important to be able to
determine the degree of enlargement under any particular
combination of lenses, and for this purpose to possess
a micrometer eye-piece, with a millimetre scale divided into
hundredths. (4) An effective microtome and the usual
mounting accessories.</p>

<p>A very important feature in the diagnosis of fibres, more
especially in regard to the composition of the fibre substances,
is the effect produced by treatment with various
reagents. Certain of these reactions
we have already <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
indicated. We shall now give the details of composition of the
several solutions which will be required.</p>

<div class="dhn">
<h4 class="h4inlineit">Neutral Mounting Solutions.</h4>—It
is advantageous in mounting
transparent objects to employ a solution of the same refractive
power as the substance itself. For this purpose, pure
glycerin or a syrupy solution of calcium chloride may be
employed; it is expedient to mix with either reagent a small
proportion of acetic acid. The designation “neutral” has
reference to the fact that these reagents are without sensible
action on the fibres.</div>

<div class="dhn">
<h4 class="h4inlineit">Iodine Solution.</h4>—We
have previously described the preparation
of a solution, giving the characteristic blue reaction
with cellulose directly. It is, however, often preferable to
bring about this colouration in another way, and the following
are the solutions employed:—1 gramme of potassium
iodide is dissolved in 100 cc. water, and the solution is
saturated with iodine; it is preserved in stoppered bottles,
containing a few fragments of the element, so as to keep up
the saturation of the solution.</div>

<p>The accessory solution, dilute sulphuric acid, which is
employed to determine the reaction between the cellulose
and the iodine, is prepared as follows:—2 volumes of concentrated
glycerin are mixed with 1 volume water, and to the
mixture an equal volume of oil of vitriol (1·78 sp. gr.), is
slowly added, so as to prevent as far as possible a rise of
temperature. The effect of the glycerin is very remarkable
in preventing the distortion of the objects under the
action of the acid, which in other respects remains uninfluenced.</p>

<p>By way of verification of this iodine test, which is somewhat
capricious, it is advisable to test the reagents with a
standard substance. The best for the purpose is a linen
yarn which has been <i>partially</i> bleached. Under the action
of the reagents the fibres composing this yarn, which must,
of course, be suitably “teazed out” for mounting, are coloured
a light blue, the centre, however, showing
a yellow line, <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span>
marking the distribution in the interior canal of a non-cellulose
fibre constituent. Should these effects not appear, it
may be concluded that the acid requires to be strengthened.
On the other hand, too great a concentration is equally to
be avoided; it is evidenced by causing a <i>distortion</i> of the
fibre, easily recognised by comparison with the fibre mounted
in a neutral medium.</p>

<div class="dhn">
<h4 class="h4inlineit">Chlorine Water.</h4>—One
of the most characteristic reactions of
lignose, or lignified cellulose, is that of combining with
chlorine. The reaction of the chlorinated derivatives with
sodium sulphite solution, is an important feature in the
microscopic diagnosis of lignified fibres and cells. The
reagent is prepared by dissolving chlorine to saturation in
water. The sodium sulphite solution is prepared by dissolving
the crystallised salt in 20 parts distilled water.</div>

<div class="dhn">
<h4 class="h4inlineit">Aniline Sulphate Solution.</h4>—With
this reagent lignose gives
a characteristic deep yellow colouration. A convenient
strength is a 2 per cent. solution of the salt. The colour is
more quickly developed if the reagent is acidified; a few
drops of sulphuric acid should therefore be added.</div>

<div class="dhn">
<h4 class="h4inlineit">Solutions of the Aniline Colours.</h4>—Some
of these are of importance
in enabling the microscopist to differentiate plant
tissues. The “affinities” of the fibre substances for these
are very various in kind and intensity. The phenomena of
staining cannot be adequately treated in our histological
scheme, which is necessarily very restricted. We, therefore,
merely mention the more important colours which are used
in staining, viz., magenta, methylene blue, eosine, diphenylamine
blue. A convenient strength is a solution of 1 in 2000.
(See also p. <a href="#p043" title="go to p. 43">43</a>.)</div>

<p>The employment of the aniline sulphate solution, as well
as of the solutions of the aniline colours, presents no difficulties,
and therefore needs no detailed de­scrip­tion. The former
strikes a more or less deep yellow with lignose; the aniline
colours stain or dye the tissue or fibre more or less deeply,
according to its composition, and, as it is
a reciprocal action, <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
according also to the composition of the colouring matter.
In following up this subject, the student will require to
consult works on vegetable histology.</p>

<div class="dhn">
<h4 class="h4inlineit">Preparation of the objects.</h4>—The
necessary preliminary to
the examination of the fibres themselves is their isolation.
This is ac­com­plished either by means of the dissecting
microscope, or more roughly, according to circumstances.
Having obtained the filaments, they are boiled in a 10 per cent.
solution of sodium carbonate until sufficiently softened to
yield easily to the “teazing” needles. In certain cases the
boiling must be supplemented by trituration in a mortar;
this, or some similar operation, is especially necessary when
the fibres are embedded in a mass of cellular tissue (parenchyma)
e. g. in the fibro-vascular bundles of monocotyledons.</div>

<p>Sections of the filaments are prepared by cutting in a
microtome, the filaments being previously agglutinated into
a stiff bundle by means of any of the usual stiffening solutions,
and after drying, embedded in wax in the usual way.
Sections of fresh stems and tissues are cut with a “section”
razor.</p>

<p>Having prepared the objects, their examination under
the microscope necessarily divides itself into:—(1) the determination
of external features; (2) the diagnosis of chemical
composition. The fibres themselves will be individually
considered in regard to microscopic features.</p>

<p>There is one aspect of these structural features, however,
which admits of more general treatment, and in respect to
this we may anticipate with advantage, viz., the dimensions
or simple elements of form. The importance of the
determination of the length and diameter of both filaments
and fibres will be readily appreciated by an inspection of
the following table, in which the numbers are given for
several of the more important.</p>

<p>A careful study of this table in relation to the
application of these several fibres, will show that
the correlation of the latter with these ultimate
dimensions is close and essential. <span class="xxpn"

<div class="section">
<p>A very important point in the diagnosis of a raw material,
and next in order of treatment, is the degree of purity of the
substance, in so far as this is related to structure. The fibres
may be associated with cellular tissue, or with cellular
debris, if they have undergone the retting process or other
treatment for separation; or with “encrusting and intercellular
substances” in various proportions. In the latter case the
association with the fibres is usually much more intimate;
they are in fact essential constituents of
the fibre <i>bundles</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
(bast-fibres, fibro-vascular bundles), whereas the former we
may regard as “foreign matter.” We may, however, distinguish
between the normal incrustation of the fibre-cells,
and such an incrustation of the filaments as would be described
as a loose adhesion of non-fibrous matter. The latter
is seen in such tissues as the bast of the adansonia, and the
fibro-vascular bundles of the aloes. These are points with
which observation alone can familiarise the student; as
experience grows he will find it increasingly easy to follow
<i>general</i> distinctions, and in proportion as he uses his own
faculties, so he will be able to generalise for himself. He
will find this equally true of the second section of the microscopic
examination, i.e., the micro-chemical diagnosis of fibres.
Under this head is included the observation of the behaviour
of fibres towards the various reagents above described. In
addition to their microscopical employment it is useful to
note their effect on fibres in the gross, both in their natural
state and after treatment with bleaching agents.</p>

<p>In applying the iodine reaction, attention must be paid to
the following details of manipulation. Place the object
(dry) upon the glass slide, moisten with a few drops of the
iodine solution, cover with a glass slip and examine under the
microscope. Note the effects, which are those of the iodine
alone. Then remove the iodine solution by means of
blotting paper, and introduce the sulphuric acid by the
method of “irrigation.” The colouration of the cellulose
(blue-violet) is immediate; it has the effect moreover, of
bringing out more clearly a number of the structural details
of the fibre.</p>

<p>We have already treated of the resolution of the raw
fibres into cellulose and non-cellulose constituents by processes
which convert the latter into soluble derivatives.
The student will derive much instruction from following up
the attendant structural disintegration with the aid of the
microscope. The chemical dissection of lignified fibres by
the alternate action of bromine water and alkalis, should be
studied by mounting specimens of the fibre at
all stages and <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
carefully noting all the changes which occur. The more
drastic action of chlorine should also be studied by mounting
the chlorinated fibre (in water) and then irrigating with the
alkaline solvent (caustic alkali or sulphite) and noting the
stages in the completion
of the disintegration.</p>

CHAPTER III.
<span class="hsmall">SCHEME FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND CHEMICAL
ANALYSIS OF PLANT SUBSTANCES.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">It will be convenient at this point to present to
the reader a general scheme for the chemical analysis of fibrous raw
material.</p>

<p>We have already discussed (p. <a href="#p004" title="go to p. 4">4</a>) the methods for the
determination of cellulose in fibrous substances. This is to
the paper-maker the most important constituent, and is that
upon which his calculations of the value of a raw material
are based. Not only, however, is it of the greatest importance
for him to be able accurately to determine the <i>amount</i>
of cellulose, but it is necessary to be able to form some idea
of the <i>nature</i> of the cellulose and also the ease with which it
can be obtained from the fibre. This latter point can only
be properly established by direct trial of the fibre under the
conditions existing in the factory. It should also be borne
in mind that these conditions influence to a considerable
degree the amount of cellulose, actually obtained in practice,
and that therefore the percentage shown by a careful
determination in the laboratory should only be taken as
an indication of the amount likely to be realized. The
student will be able, from what has been said before of the
properties of the different celluloses, to apply his knowledge
to a determination of any particular specimen. In
order to supplement this knowledge, it may be well at this
particular point to cite the chief results of an investigation
bearing upon this point by Webster (Chem. Soc. Journ., 1883,
p. 23).</p>

<p>His method of investigation consisted
in (1) estimating <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
the cellulose; (2) determining the loss sustained by the
fibre when boiled for 5 minutes, and also for 60 minutes,
with an alkaline solution (caustic soda 1 per cent. Na<sub>2</sub>O),
the former being taken to represent the purely solvent action,
the difference between the two amounts being an indication
of the <i>degrading</i> action of the soda; (3) determining the
ultimate composition (C H and O) of the fibre substance. It
should be observed that the specimens were carefully averaged
and purified by boiling in glacial acetic acid and in alcohol.
On carefully considering the following table it will be seen
that the chief points brought out by Webster’s investigation
are (1) the association of a low carbon percentage with
pectous properties and considerable degrading action on long
boiling in alkali. The bearing of this will be better understood
in connection with a discussion of the properties of
pectic acid (p. <a href="#p028" title="go to p. 28">28</a>) and the oxycelluloses (p. <a href="#p013" title="go to p. 13">13</a>). (2.) The
influence of the composition of the original fibre on the
isolated cellulose.</p>

<p>The solutions of aniline sulphate and of the aniline colours
give valuable aid in a diagnosis of plant substances. Webster
observed, as was to be expected, that the yellow colour produced
could be taken as an indication of the amount of
lignification, those fibres which were of a pectous nature
showing little or no colour. On the other hand, when the
fibres were treated with a neutral solution of the so-called
alkali-blue it was found that the converse took place, highly
pectous fibres being dyed much more deeply than those
which were lignified. (Compare the action of aniline colours
on oxycellulose, p. <a href="#p011" title="go to p. 11">11</a>.)</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="dhn"><h4 class="h4inlineplain"><span
class="smcap">B<b>AST</b></span> <span
class="smcap">T<b>ISSUES.</b></span></h4>—We have alluded, in our
opening remarks, to the broad division of the bast of exogen or
di­cot­y­le­don­ous plants into coherent and non-coherent tissues. We
have now considered the more important of the latter, and we find that
they are obtained from the stems of annuals. We find also that while
they constitute a tissue, in the sense of being definitely localised,
the constituent fibres are disposed in parallel series of independent
bundles or filaments, which are isolated by a mechanical operation
after the whole stem has undergone the preparatory retting process. In
exogens of longer and larger growth, the bast, as might be expected,
becomes a coherent compound tissue, which is, in many cases, easily
detached from the underlying wood. We shall mention three of these as
receiving very important applications; though only one has been applied
to any extent by the papermakers of this country. This, which we shall
consider first, is the bast of the <i>Adansonia digitata</i>, or baobab,
a tree which flourishes in the tropical regions of the West Coast of
Africa. It is exported chiefly from Loanga, in the form of fibrous
lumps of a brown colour. These are seen to be composed of a network of
bast bundles, which are but slightly coloured, intersected by medullary
rays of a dark brown colour. The microscopic features of the fibre are
those which are generally characteristic of the bast of exogens; we do
not know that we could cite any whereby it could be identified with
certainty. <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span></div>

<p>The fibres give a yellow colouration with aniline sulphate,

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineplain"><i>Linden Bast</i> (<i>Tilia
Europæa</i>)</h5> is the raw material employed in the manufacture in
Russia of the mats so largely used in this country for wrapping
furniture and heavy goods, and also by gardeners for a variety of
purposes. One of the features of this bast is the strong cohesion of
the fibres in the bundles or filaments. They are resolved, but with
difficulty, on long boiling, with a solution of carbonate of soda, the
soluble products being of a mucilaginous nature. This bast has not been
applied to any extent by the paper-makers of this country.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineplain"><i>Bast of the Paper Mulberry</i>
(<i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i>).</h5>—This product deserves mention, not
from its importance to the European papermaker, but because of its
application to the manufacture of the peculiar papers of the Chinese
and Japanese. The special features of this, and the other basts which
are similarly employed in these <span class="nowrap">countries—</span><i>Edgworthia papyrifera</i>,
<i>Broussonetia kaempferia</i>, are (1), the ease with which the coherent
fibrous tissue is separated from the parenchymatous tissue which
accompanies it; (2), its comparative freedom from medullary rays; (3),
the great length and fineness of the fibres. These properties conduce
to its ready conversion into a well felted paper, of great tensile
strength and remarkable softness.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineplain">Class C.</h3>—These are
whole stems of mono­cot­y­le­don­ous annuals. The isolation of fibres
for paper-making from these plants depends upon a chemical process of
resolution; the <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span> pulp obtained
is, therefore, a complex of the various orders of cell-fibres contained
in the plant. While the pulp consists for the most part of the vessels
of the fibro-vascular bundles, it contains in addition the serrated
cuticular cells which are so characteristic of this group. They
therefore present a general similarity in microscopic features; there
are, however, certain individual characteristics, such as the form and
dimensions of particular cells, which serve for the identification of
the various pulps. Where such occur they will be indicated.</div>

<span class="hsmall">
PROCESSES FOR ISOLATING CELLULOSE FROM
PLANT SUBSTANCES.</span></h2>

<p>We are now in a position to discuss generally the various
methods by which the paper-maker obtains cellulose from
the different raw materials. The special treatments necessary
for each of the more important of these will be given more
fully subsequently. These methods, though they vary considerably
with the different materials to be treated, may be
roughly divided into two groups—the alkaline and the acid
processes. The former, which we will call <i>a</i>, comprises all
processes in which caustic soda, carbonate of soda and lime,
or mixtures of these are employed; the latter, <i>b</i>, the various
processes which have been introduced of late years, involving
the use of sulphurous acid, either alone or in combination
with a base, such as lime or magnesia.</p>

<p>The processes in group <i>a</i> may be applied to the treatment
of every known fibrous vegetable material; those in group <i>b</i>
are at the present time applied exclusively to the preparation
of pulp from wood.</p>

<p>Group <i>a</i> may be conveniently subdivided according to the
nature of the materials operated upon.</p>

<p>It is obvious that those materials, such as bleached cotton
and linen threads and rags, which have already undergone
treatment by the textile manufacturer, and are therefore
more or less already in the state of pure cellulose, require but
little chemical treatment at the hands of the paper-maker,
whose attention is therefore chiefly directed to the removal
of such adventitious matters as size, grease, &#x26;c. This can
generally be effected by the employment of weak solutions
of caustic soda, or even of lime at
a low pressure. <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span></p>

<p>We now have to consider the treatment of those materials
which consist of the compound celluloses.</p>

<p>All methods for the isolation of cellulose from the compound
celluloses depend upon a hydrolytic resolution of their constituents,
i.e. a splitting up by combination with water into
cellulose on the one hand, and a series of soluble derivatives on
the other. This, as will be shown, may to a certain extent
be ac­com­plished by the action of water itself at a high
temperature. As, however, the products of such an action
are acid bodies, which, if allowed to remain in contact with
the cellulose, would injuriously affect it, and would induce
the production of complicated bodies, the removal of which
from the cellulose would become increasingly difficult, it is
necessary to have present a body such as caustic soda, which
by combining with these acid bodies, removes them as such
from the sphere of action.</p>

<p>In certain raw materials, such as straw and esparto, we
have, in addition to the compound celluloses which form, so
to speak, the groundwork, a certain proportion of fatty and
resinous bodies, whose removal is brought about by the action
of the caustic soda converting them into soaps.</p>

<p>The compound celluloses may be divided, as we have seen,
into three classes—pecto-celluloses, ligno-celluloses, and
adipo-celluloses. The last-named being present in only a
few paper-making materials, and then only in very small
proportion, is without any practical interest. We are concerned
therefore with the two former only.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Pecto-celluloses.</i>—From what we have seen of the nature
of the pecto-celluloses, it follows that for their resolution a
tolerably simple treatment with soda will be sufficient.</p>

<p>The chief members of this group in which the paper-maker
is interested, are esparto and straw. The former being but
very slightly lignified, its resolution can be effected at a very
low pressure; in fact it is even possible by using tolerably
strong solutions to do it by boiling in open vessels.</p>

<p>Straw, on the other hand, though it possesses certain
features in common with esparto, is more
lignified, and in <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span>
consequence, necessitates a much more energetic action to
complete its resolution. It is therefore usual to boil it at
somewhat high pressures (40–70 lb.), and with larger
quantities of soda than are demanded in the case of esparto.
It is, moreover, essential, so to regulate the treatment, that
even the most resistent portions of the straw, such, for
example, as the knots, shall be completely resolved, otherwise
unbleached portions are liable to find their way into
the finished paper. By increasing the quantity of soda, it is
possible to boil under reduced pressure, and <i>vice versâ</i>; this
may be taken as a general principle applicable in all other
cases.</p>

<p>We now come to the second class of celluloses, that is to
say, the ligno-celluloses. Of these, perhaps the most important
are jute, manilla, and wood.</p>

<p>For their <i>complete</i> resolution, it is imperative to employ
very strong solutions at very high temperatures and
pressures; thus in the case of wood it is necessary to boil at
temperatures corresponding to a pressure of 100–120 lb. per
square inch.</p>

<p>The use of strong caustic soda solutions at high temperatures
is attended with very serious objections, apart from
the question of cost. Among these may be mentioned the
destructive action of the soda upon the cellulose itself,
involving a considerable loss of pulp; the de-hydration, condensation,
and oxidation of the non-cellulose portion of the
fibre (which, as we have seen (p. <a href="#p025" title="go to p. 25">25</a>) is of the nature of an
aldehyde, and therefore peculiarly susceptible of such
changes), and the formation of dark coloured products which
remain intimately combined with the residual cellulose; the
inconvenience of working at very high temperatures and
pressures.</p>

<p>With a view to removing the difficulties attending the use
of soda, various processes have from time to time been
proposed, in which the hydrolytic agent is a solution of
sulphurous acid in water, either alone or in combination
with a base. These processes are comprised
under group B. <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
Several of them have lately acquired great commercial and
industrial importance, and a clear understanding of them is
therefore essential to the student of paper-making.</p>

<p>Though applicable to lignified fibres generally, they have
only been applied up to the present time to wood, and it is
in this connection, therefore, that we propose to consider
them.</p>

<p>In order to bring out more clearly the fundamental differences
underlying the two classes of processes, it will be
well to consider, somewhat in detail, these processes, which,
although they have now a merely historical interest, will
assist the student in thoroughly grasping the rationale of
the modern and improved methods.</p>

<p>Water Process.—Wood is to a certain extent resolved by
treatment with water at a high temperature, the degree of
disintegration being, within certain limits, proportional to
the temperature at which it is digested. The volatile products
of the resolution are chiefly acids of the acetic series,
furfurol and terpenes. The non-volatile soluble products are
for the most part acids. This process was studied by Fry,
who, in 1866, made it the subject of a patent. He found that
under the most favourable conditions of treatment, the yield
of brown pulp amounted to 70 per cent. of the wood employed.
The objections to the process were sufficiently
obvious: the pulp produced was of low quality, and the
soluble products acted powerfully on the iron digesters
employed. The chemical causes of its failure lie in the prominence
of the conditions which determine re-combinations
of the products of resolution with one another, viz. oxidation,
high temperature, and the presence of acids. It is worthy
of note that in one experiment the amount of acids produced
from 100 parts wood were equivalent to 3·4 parts of soda
<span class="nowrap">(Na<sub>2</sub>O).</span>
This was by far the most serious defect in the
process, and it eventually caused its abandonment in favour
of the older method of treatment with caustic alkali.<a

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc9" id="fn9">9</a>
See Journ. Soc. of Arts., February 1883, p. 223.</p></div>

<p>Alkali Processes.—The first to develop
the alkali process <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
were Watt and Burgess, in America (1853–1857), and
Houghton in this country. To follow up the several modifications
introduced is unnecessary; they differ from one
another in the economical balance which they strike between
temperature and quantity of chemicals: thus Watt and
Burgess employed a lye of 12°&#x2005;Baumé, and digested at 60 lb.
pressure (equal to 152°&#x2005;C.), whereas Houghton used a lye of
4°&#x2005;B., at 100–180 lb. One great defect of these processes was
the gradual neutralisation of the alkali, necessitating as a
compensating condition the employment of a very high temperature
towards the end of the operation. To overcome
this objection, Ungerer devised a process which aimed at
securing a properly graduated action of the lye. This process,
being based on an eminently rational view of the action
of the alkali, is worthy of a more extended notice, especially
as the principle on which it is founded is capable of wide
application. A system of nine vertical digesters, connected
together in series by means of pipes and cocks, so that the
liquid contents can be transferred from one to the other in
succession, is the main feature of the method employed. In
connection with this system there is a double service of
pipes, by which the hot soda lye at 90 lb. pressure, and cold
water, may be respectively introduced. The operation is so
conducted that in five of the digesters wood is being treated
at a high temperature, in three the pulp is being washed,
while the remaining one is being charged with fresh wood.</p>

<p>The whole round of operations may be described thus,
numbering the digesters according to their position in the
series:—Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Washing the finished pulp; 4, Final
treatment with lye at the extreme pressure of 90 lb.; 5,
Digesting at lower pressure with lye previously employed
in 4; 6, Treatment at still lower pressure with lye which
has already done duty in 4 and 5; and so on to 8, where the
liquor, having passed through the series, is employed at
15–20 lb. pressure on a fresh charge of wood. The washings
are conducted in such a way that the water which is introduced
into 1 displaces the solution in
each digester without <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span>
the last being allowed to escape. The introduction of the
fresh liquor at 4 is similarly ac­com­plished, 1, 2, and 3 being
cut off by closing the cocks which control the ingress and
egress of liquid.</p>

<p>The pulp produced by this method is of a sufficiently pale
colour to be capable of application for many purposes without
bleaching. It is converted into a perfectly white pulp by
treatment in the ordinary way with from 3 to 4 per cent. of
bleaching powder, calculated in the dry pulp.</p>

<p>As far as it goes the method is practically perfect, and it
appears to have given sound results, at least as regards the
main product. The principal disadvantages were the complications
attending such an elaborate system of working
which would doubtless make it costly.</p>

<p>We have next to consider a class of processes which are
based primarily upon the action of an alkali, but which
introduce the simultaneous action of a soluble sulphide,
generally that of sodium. As far back as 1855 Jullion
patented in this country a process of this nature, which,
however, does not appear to have been applied to wood. The
results obtained with such materials as straw and esparto
appear to have been very unsatisfactory, and to have led to
the early abandonment of the method.</p>

<p>Recently the increased attention which has been given to
wood as a raw material has led to a revival of these sulphide
processes for its treatment. We believe that at least two
processes of this class are being worked on the continent,
viz. those of Dahl and Blitz.</p>

<p>That of the former consists in heating wood, at pressures
varying from 60–120 lb. per square inch, with a solution of
the following <span class="nowrap">composition:—</span></p>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span></div>

<p class="pcontinue">This solution is obtained only after the process has been
some time at work, and it then remains tolerably constant.</p>

<p>The wood, to commence with, is boiled with a solution
containing a large quantity of sodium sulphate, with a
small quantity of sodium hydrate, obtained by boiling sodium
sulphate with lime. The liquor from this operation is then
evaporated and calcined, the result being a fused mass which,
when dissolved in water, yields a liquor containing the above-mentioned
ingredients. The loss of chemicals is made up by
the addition of fresh quantities of sodium sulphate.</p>

<p>From experiments which the authors have made with this
process, it appears, that while it is perfectly true that pulp
can be obtained, it is necessary to employ either very strong
solution or very high pressures. This is equivalent to saying
that either the hydrolytic action is weak, or the tendencies
to reversal of the hydrolysis are strong, and indeed both are
to be predicted from the nature of the solution. One great
objection to the process is that during the boiling a quantity
of very foully-smelling compounds are produced.</p>

<p>The process of Blitz consists in heating wood to from
50–60 lb. pressure, with a solution of sodium sulphide, containing
an infinitesimal proportion of vanadate of ammonia.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see what influence the presence of the
costly vanadate of ammonia can have on the result. Actual
experiment on this point has failed to convince us of its
efficacy.</p>

<p>Although in these sulphide processes a strongly reducing
agent is present, its effect in preventing oxidation is more
than outweighed by the weakening of the hydrolytic action
of the soda, both directly by its combination with sulphur,
and indirectly by the complication which it induces by
combination with the soluble bye-products. Further, as
regards the final product, they offer no advantage over the
caustic alkali processes. There is, however, a considerable
advantage in point of economy, which should lead to their
adoption in districts where the production of malodorous
gases is permitted. <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span></p>

<p>Acid Processes.—We now come to consider the processes
which are based upon the hydrolytic action of acids as a
primary condition. We have seen that in the water process
this condition obtains as a secondary result, and that while it
aids in resolving the wood, it also determines the limit of the
action, in consequence of its promoting secondary combination
amongst the soluble products. The use of powerful
oxidising acids, such as nitric and nitro-hydrochloric, induces
an action which is sufficiently drastic to cause a
complete resolution of the non-cellulose constituents of the
wood with the formation of soluble products. The use of
these acids has been made the subject of numerous patents.</p>

<p>The process of Barre and Blondel consisted in digesting
the wood in the cold for twenty-four hours in 50 per cent.
nitric acid, by which it was converted into a soft fibrous
mass. This was boiled for some hours in water, afterwards
in a solution of sodium carbonate, and finally bleached in the
ordinary way. Many other patents have been taken out in
this direction, but none have met with practical success,
owing doubtless, to the high cost of nitric acid, and the
difficulty of recovery. A process has lately been patented by
Young and Pettigrew (No. 14,988, 1884) in which they claim
the use of either nitric or nitrous acids; the acid fumes which
are evolved being condensed and reconverted into nitric acid.
The process has not yet, however, been tried on a practical
scale.</p>

<p>The resolution of wood by the hydrolytic action of non-oxidising
acids, is for reasons already stated, very imperfect.
An important feature, however, of this action is the production
of glucose as a bye-product, and a process having the
double object of producing this, together with a brown pulp,
was patented by Bachet and Machard in 1864, and worked
for some time in Switzerland. The process consisted in
boiling the wood for twelve hours in dilute hydrochloric
acid; the solution, which contained glucose to the amount of
20 per cent. of the weight of the wood, was drawn off,
neutralised with chalk, and fermented by
the addition of <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
yeast. Alcohol was separated from the fermented liquor in
the usual way. The residual pulp, after being ground with
stones, was made into coarse packing paper. The process
failed commercially.</p>

<p>The next processes in the order of the development of our
subject, but not chronologically, are those involving the use
of reducing acids, i.e. those which combine with their
hydrolytic function a de-oxidising or anti-oxidising action.
Of these the only one which has been practically investigated
is sulphurous acid. A full account of the earlier discoveries
in regard to the use of this reagent, for the special purpose
under consideration, will be found in the <i>Papier Zeitung</i>,
1884, No. 51, p. 1927; this should be consulted by those
who are interested in the history of a subject which has
now grown to be of the first importance.</p>

<p>The first patented process claiming the use of sulphurous
acid, in the form of its aqueous solution, for the purpose of
disintegrating wood, was that of Tilghmann (1866). So far
as is known, however, the results obtained by the inventor
with the acid alone were such as to lead him to abandon
it for solutions containing a certain proportion of base. The
reasons, doubtless, were the greater facility of preparation
and simplicity of application of such solutions.</p>

<p>More recently Professor Pictet, of Geneva, on the basis of
the experience acquired by him in the preparation and
employment of sulphurous acid in his patent freezing processes,
has revived and perfected a process which in other hands
had proved impracticable.</p>

<p>The method and apparatus employed will be found fully
described in the author’s specification. The process consists
in digesting the wood in closed vessels with an aqueous
solution of the acid (10–12 per cent. SO<sub>2</sub>) at 176°–194°&#x2005;F.
(80°–90°&#x2005;C.), and under the corresponding pressure (60–75 lb.
per square inch). A complete disintegration of pine wood is
effected in about twenty-four hours’ treatment. The yield
of pulp is, we are informed, from 40–50 per cent. of the wood
(<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>); it is also stated to
be readily bleached <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
with a moderate amount of bleaching powder, and to yield a
pulp of the highest quality. Further, the recovery of the
sulphurous acid, for which special apparatus is provided, is
practically complete (95–98 per cent.). In view of the
probable utilisation of the bye-products, it is interesting to
observe that they are obtained in a form in which they can
very readily be treated.</p>

<p>The process being as yet undeveloped on a large scale, we
cannot do more than recommend it to the consideration of
paper-makers. At the same time we would draw attention
to the features of interest which it possesses in regard to the
general aspect of our subject. The resolution which it effects
is obviously one of simple hydrolysis, and it affords an indirect
proof of the chemical complications which attend all
other processes for disintegrating wood which employ temperature
much above the boiling-point of water. The soluble
bye-products are obtained in the simplest form, and may be
isolated by mere evaporation. As regards the chemical
features of the pulp, they will presumably be different from
those of any other, whether on the side of advantage or not
it remains to decide. Provided the process fulfils the condition
of economical working, we have no hesitation in predicting
for it a considerable development.</p>

<p>The difficulties attending the employment of a gaseous
acid have doubtless operated in deterring many, in addition
to the originator, from a complete investigation of its action,
and have led them to adopt in preference one of its several
compounds with bases, the employment of which defines a
group of processes to which we now desire to call attention.
There is a variety of processes agreeing in the essential
feature of employing a bisulphite as the disintegrating
reagent, and differing from one another only in the less
essential details of method.</p>

<p>The general principle of these processes will be readily understood
from what has gone before. The chief agency is the hydrolytic action
of sulphurous acid, aided by the conditions of high temperature and
pressure: and the subsidiary <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
agencies are—(1) The prevention of oxidation; (2) The removal from the
sphere of action of the soluble products of resolution in combination
with the sulphite as a true double compound. This mode of union is well
known to be peculiarly characteristic of all aldehydes, to which class
we have shown that the non-cellulose constituents of wood belong. The
combination is expressed by the general <span class="nowrap">equation—</span></p>

<p class="pcontinue">(3) The removal of a portion of the constituents
in combination with the base, i.e. with expulsion of sulphurous
acid.</p>

<p>The verification of these views has been afforded in the
course of an investigation of the bye-products from the Ekman
process, undertaken by the authors for Messrs. Thomson,
Bonar &#x26; Co., the proprietors of the patent.</p>

<p>As the various bisulphite processes differ chiefly in their
working details, the essential feature of the employment of a
solution of sulphurous acid, combined with a certain amount
of base, being common to them all, it will not be necessary to
do more than examine one or two typical cases. We shall select
those of Ekman and Partington, the latter being based upon
Francke’s patent, with certain modifications and additions.</p>

<p>(1) The Chemicals employed.—In both cases sulphur is
used as the source of the sulphurous acid. The Ekman
process starts from magnesite, a native carbonate of magnesia.
This is converted by calcination into magnesia, and in this
state is introduced into lead-lined towers, through which is
passed sulphurous acid gas, obtained by burning sulphur in
suitable furnaces, while a stream of water trickles down from
the top. The supply of the gas being properly adjusted, a
continuous production of a solution of magnesium bisulphite
of uniform strength is obtained. To secure this uniformity,
constant attention is necessary, and further, the loss of sulphurous
acid by oxidation to sulphuric acid, and by diffusion,
is, in consequence of its distribution over so
large a surface, <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
and with free exposure to the air, necessarily very large.
It is unnecessary, however, to point out that the preparation
of the magnesium bisulphite is capable of very considerable
modification; in fact, we understand that numerous improvements
in this direction have already been introduced by the
proprietors of the process.</p>

<p>Partington’s method, in addition to the advantage of starting
from lime, the cheapest of all basic substances, is free
from the disadvantages referred to as attending the use of
a tower. It consists in passing the sulphurous acid gas
through a series of three vessels connected together with
pipes. Into these vessels a charge of milk of lime is introduced,
and the two first being closed air-tight, the gas is
passed in. The third remains open to the air, and from it
escapes a continuous stream of nitrogen, resulting from the
removal of the oxygen by the burning sulphur, from the
stream of air which is blown through the sulphur retort at
a pressure of 5 lb. to the square inch. The expenditure for
chemicals is under 1<i>l.</i> per ton, whereas, by the Ekman process,
it has been variously estimated at from 2<i>l.</i> to 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per ton.
Provided therefore, that as good pulp can be obtained by
Partington as by Ekman, the former offers considerable
advantages both from point of view of simplicity and economy.
Doubtless the cost of chemicals could be somewhat reduced
in both systems by the adoption of a cheaper form of sulphur,
such as pyrites.</p>

<p>Preparation of the Wood.—Although the acid sulphite
processes can, by suitable modifications, be made available for
the preparation of cellulose from almost all kinds of wood,
yet it is necessary, in order to insure uniformity of result,
not only to take care that the wood is carefully selected, but
that it is freed from bark and roots, which, if allowed to
remain, would be imperfectly pulped, and would be exceedingly
difficult to bleach. The most suitable kind of wood is
<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>.</p>

<p>After the bark has been carefully removed the logs are
sawn into boards of ordinary
sizes. This treatment <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
exposes the knots, which are then removed either by boring
or cutting out with an axe. The pieces are then passed
through a machine, which cuts them or rather breaks them
into fragments about an inch long. In order that the acid
sulphite may as quickly as possible enter into the wood,
these fragments must be crushed and opened out by passing
through heavy rollers: moreover, the wood is cut <i>across</i> the
grain, by which means it is more or less split up into laminæ.
A machine for this purpose has been patented by Fry,
Ransome, and Wilkie (No. 11,389, 1884).</p>

<p>The Boiling Process.—Ekman uses a lead-lined, jacketed
cylindrical boiler, suspended on trunnions, so that it can be
turned upside down for discharging. The pressure in the
outer jacket is 70 lb. per square inch, while inside the
boiler it is 90 lb., the difference being due to the tension of
the sulphurous acid gas. The duration of boiling is from ten
to twelve hours. Partington, on the other hand, boils with
live steam, and therefore is enabled to use a boiler of simpler
construction. His boilers are spherical, lead-lined and
rotary. The pressure employed does not exceed 60 lb. per
square inch, the time of boiling being about sixteen hours.</p>

<p>Various other sulphite processes have been from time to
time devised, which differ but little either in principle or in
working detail from those described, and therefore a brief
mention of them will suffice. Mitscherlich employs a
bisulphite of lime in somewhat weaker solution than that
employed by Francke or Partington, and in order to produce
the same result he is obliged to extend the time of boiling to
from 40 to 60 hours.</p>

<p>Graham, after treating the wood with a mono-sulphite,
injects into the boiler either a solution of a bisulphite or
gaseous or liquid sulphurous acid.</p>

<p>Flodgvist uses a solution prepared by dissolving bones in
sulphurous acid solution.</p>

<p>The cellulosic products of the various processes present
certain slight differences, but so far as has been investigated,
not such as to constitute a distinct advantage
for one or <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
another. One feature of these processes, to which but little
attention has hitherto been paid, is that of the utilisation of
their bye-products. These bodies are, as already indicated,
obtained in a condition not materially different from that of
the parent substance, the non-cellulose constituents of the
wood. One important property of these bodies, and one
capable of considerable application, has been made the basis
of a patent by the authors. When a solution of gelatin is
added to the liquors in which wood has been treated by any
of the bisulphite or sulphurous acid processes, a body is precipitated
in the form of a caoutchouc-like mass which can be
dissolved in neutral sodium sulphite solution, or in weakly
alkaline solutions, and can be reprecipitated on addition of alum
to the solution. The substance consists of a compound of the
gelatin with the non-cellulose constituents resembling, but not
identical with, as has been supposed, the precipitate obtained
by adding tannic acid to a solution of gelatin. The solution
of this substance in sodium sulphite can be applied to many
of the purposes to which gelatin itself is ordinarily applied.</p>

<p>A serious objection to all processes involving the use of
sulphurous acid or acid sulphite, and one which has to some
extent deterred paper-makers from adopting them, is the
necessity of using a boiler lined with lead. In addition to
the fact that such boilers are heavy and costly, they are
objectionable on account of the difficulty and expense of
keeping them in thorough repair. This difficulty arises
from the fact that, owing to the different co-efficients of
expansion of lead and iron, the lead lining originally placed
in contact with the iron or steel shell of the boiler, becoming
detached on heating, swells out in various places, which are
thus rendered weaker and liable to fracture. This is
especially the case if, in the course of lining the boiler, any
air has been allowed to remain between the two linings.
Various expedients have been proposed to obviate these
defects but with only partial success. Graham (Eng. Pat.
No. 5367, 1883) coats the plate of his boiler by pouring
molten lead upon the perfectly clean surface
which has been <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span>
previously prepared with zinc chloride. Sometimes minute
holes are drilled in the iron plate to allow the escape of air.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the attempts that have been made,
the use of a lead-lined boiler is a serious objection, and any
process which will fulfil the conditions on which the bi-sulphite
processes depend, and which at the same time
admits of the use of the ordinary iron boilers, is an obvious
desideratum. Such a process is that patented by one of the
authors (Cross, No. 4984, 1880), claiming the use of solutions
of the neutral sulphites with or without the further addition
of an alkali. This process is very suitable for the treatment
of fibres such as straw, jute, &#x26;c., but not economically applicable
to the preparation of wood pulp on account of the cost
of chemicals. The preservative effect of the sulphite is
shown by the largely increased yield of pulp.</p>

<p>The chief advantages of the various bi-sulphite processes
for the preparation of wood pulp over the old soda processes
are, (1) the increased yield of fibre; (2) the preservation of
its original strength, and (3), the economy in chemicals.</p>

<p>It is well known that cellulose, even in its most stable
forms, is attacked more or less by hot solutions of the caustic
alkalis, and is more or less profoundly modified according to
the strength of the solution and the temperature at which it
is employed; while on the other hand the solutions of the bisulphites
affect it but little. Thus, the authors have exposed
jute cellulose, which is of the same nature as that obtained
from wood, to the action of magnesium bisulphite under the
conditions which obtain in the Ekman process, without its
undergoing sensible loss of weight, and further, they have
determined the amount of cellulose in freshly cut grasses,
in which it is but imperfectly elaborated, and therefore very
susceptible of modification, both before and after treatment
by the process, and in each case the percentage obtained
was the same.</p>

<p>There is therefore no doubt that in the bisulphite processes,
even the structurally delicate forms of cellulose are conserved.
As before indicated, the influence of this upon the yield of
cellulose is of course very marked; the yield
from white pine, <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
by the soda process, being approximately 33 per cent., whereas
by the Ekman process it is from 45–50 per cent. It is important
to remember that this increased yield of cellulose
cannot fail to affect the quality, and therefore the paper-making
properties of the pulp. Papers made entirely by the
bisulphite processes have a strongly marked individuality,
being distinguished by their hardness and transparency. In
regard to the bleaching of the pulp, it will be found that
some practical experience is required for the control of the
operation, so as to produce uniform results.</p>

<p>Although the pulp produced by these processes is of a very
light-grey colour, so light indeed that they may be used for
certain low classes of white paper without further treatment,
yet to obtain a pure white colour almost as much bleaching
powder is required as in the case of soda pulps, although the
latter are much darker in colour. The chief points to be
observed are (1) the complete removal of the sulphites from
the pulp before the addition of bleaching liquor, which would
otherwise be ineffectively consumed; (2) the avoidance, in
washing, of waters containing iron, which would combine
with certain constituents of the pulp to form dark-coloured
bodies.</p>

<p>The following Table, compiled from Dr. Hugo Müller’s
‘Pflanzenfaser,’ is of interest, as indicating the probable
yield of pulp from different woods, compared with the amounts
obtained in actual practice by the Watt and Burgess (soda)
<span class="nowrap">process:—</span></p>

CHAPTER VI.
<span class="hsmall">
SPECIAL TREATMENT OF VARIOUS FIBRES;
BOILERS, BOILING PROCESSES, ETC.</span></h2>

<p>We have already, in Chapter V., discussed in a general way
the principles upon which the treatment of the various fibres
should be based; we now proceed to consider each fibre in
detail, giving at the same time such information as is necessary
regarding the preliminary treatment of the various fibres
and describing the forms of apparatus in which these operations
are conducted. We shall consider the fibres in the
order of their simplicity of treatment.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Rags</h3>
(Linen and Cotton).—The treatment necessary for
rags differs largely with the quality and, of course, with the
kind of paper for which they are intended. These different
qualities are known in the trade by different names and
marks, such for example as the following:—New linen
pieces, new cotton pieces, superfines, dark fines, grey linen,
sailcloth, seconds, thirds, &#x26;c., &#x26;c.</div>

<p>The two former consist of the cuttings produced in the
manufacture of various garments, &#x26;c.; not having been
worn, they are usually free from dirt, and are, in fact, if
bleached, nearly pure cellulose, containing only the starch
and other sizing material which has been added in the
process of finishing the goods. They may, of course, contain
considerable quantities of china clay or other loading material.
In purchasing rags, therefore, regard should be had to the
probable presence of these bodies. Such rags require only a
very slight treatment; in fact, for certain classes of paper
they might be used without any preparation. If, as is sometimes
the case, the rags are unbleached, a rather more severe
boiling is necessary. <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span></p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/i080.png" width="600" height="456" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
16.</div></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>The greater part of the rags used in paper-making,
however, consist of the residual portions of garments, household
linen, &#x26;c., which vary in quality from clean, almost
unused portions, to the very foulest sorts; the latter require
a very drastic treatment. The first thing to be done with
the rags is to “sort” and cut them into convenient pieces.
This is usually done by women, who stand at tables furnished
with broad knives firmly fixed into them, with the backs
towards the worker, and inclined at a slight angle. Near to
the women are placed a number of boxes, corresponding with
the number of qualities of rags, lined at the bottom with
coarse wire gauze, into which the different sorts are put. The
distinctions made are purely arbitrary, but as a general rule
the rags are sorted with special reference to their colour and
the material of which they are composed. The coloured rags
may be allowed to accumulate, and then made into a coloured
paper. During the process of cutting,
all hard substances, <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
such as buttons, pieces of iron, &#x26;c., are carefully removed.
The rags are cut into pieces of from two to five inches
square. In some mills machines are used for cutting.</p>

<p>Fig. 16 shows the construction of a machine that may be
used either for rags or rope. The material is passed into the
machine along the table A, where it passes between the
stationary knife C and the knives B, fixed in the revolving
drum D. The cut rags fall into a receptacle placed underneath
the drum.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the extra expense of cutting by hand, it
is nevertheless preferred by many, especially for the finer
grades of paper. One reason for this is to be found in the
fact that more perfect sorting and removal of impurities can
be effected. It is moreover said that less waste of fibre

<p>The next process which the rags undergo is that of removing
all loose extraneous matter. This may be done in
a machine such as is shown in Fig. 17. The rags are fed
continuously by the endless travelling platform A into the
willow. This consists of two wrought-iron drums, B&#xa0;B,
furnished with wrought-iron teeth C, which when the drums
revolve pass rapidly near to the stationary teeth fixed
into the cast-iron framework of the willow. The sides are
covered in with cast-iron doors, and the top
is covered over <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
with sheet iron. Underneath the drums is a grating for the
escape of dust.</p>

<p>The rags, having been thoroughly beaten by the teeth of
the drums, pass into the duster D, consisting of a kind of
hollow cylinder E, made of strong iron bars securely fastened
to the circular ends F, the bars being covered with wire
cloth or perforated zinc. It is made to revolve almost
horizontally, a slight dip being given to it in order that the
rags may be carried forward to the lower end. The bars or
skeleton of the cylinder are furnished with a number of
teeth securely bolted on. The whole is enclosed in a strong
wooden box in which it revolves, and which serves to collect
the dust passing through the wire cloth. The cylinder E is
driven by the gearing G. This combined willow and duster
may be used for dusting and cleaning not only rags, but
almost any other kind of fibre. The willow and duster
sometimes form two separate machines.</p>

<p>The cleaned and dusted rags are now ready to be boiled,
although it is the practice in some mills to give them a
preliminary washing with water.</p>

<p>The boiling may be conducted either in spherical or
cylindrical boilers, or in the ordinary vomiting boilers
described under Esparto. (See p. <a href="#p092" title="go to p. 92">92</a>.) In Fig. 18 is shown,
part in section and part in elevation, a spherical rag-boiler,
as manufactured by Messrs. G. &#x26; W. Bertram.</p>

<p>This boiler, of from 8 to 9 feet diameter, is supported by
means of the hollow journals A on the standards B, and is
made to revolve by means of the gearing C.</p>

<p>Steam enters by the pipe D, which is fitted with a safety-valve
E, and vacuum valve F. The steam on entering the
boiler is distributed by means of the “baffle-plate” G. Lye
enters by the pipe H. The boiler is fitted with two doors I,
wherewith to fill and empty; the waste lye is run off by the
cock J. L is a small blow-through cock. The false bottom
K prevents the rags from choking up the cock and also
serves to drain off the waste liquor.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The alkali employed may be either
caustic lime, caustic <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span>
soda, sodium carbonate, or a mixture of the latter and lime,
which is of course equivalent to using caustic soda. The
proportion of alkali depends upon so many considerations
that it is quite impossible to give exact information on this
point. In the case of caustic soda, a quantity equal to from
5–10 per cent. on the rags may be taken to be a fair average.
If lime be used it should be slaked with water, made into a
thin milk and carefully filtered through fine wire cloth to
keep back the particles of sand, coal, &#x26;c., which lime is
always liable to contain. From 5–10 per cent. may be used.
The amount of lime actually dissolved in the water is
relatively small (1·3 grms. per litre); the portion in solution
however, rapidly combines with the grease, dirt, and colouring
matter of the rags and forms with them insoluble compounds,
a fresh portion of lime being at the same time dissolved.
This formation of insoluble compounds constitutes
an important objection to the use of lime, as
they are liable <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
to remain to some extent fixed in the rags and are with
great difficulty removed by washing. For this reason, therefore,
the more soluble alkali is to be preferred. Moreover,
the lime sometimes tends to exert a hardening effect upon the
cellulose. Notwithstanding these objections, lime is used by
some paper-makers in preference to soda. In making choice
of the chemical for boiling, much depends on the quality of
the rags and the nature of the paper for which they are
intended, so that no definite rules can be given.</p>

<p>The time of boiling varies from 2 to 6 hours, according
to the quality of rags, the chemical employed, and the
pressure. The use of very high pressures should be avoided
as far as possible, as there is a danger, owing to the correspondingly
high temperature, of <i>fixing</i> the dirt and colouring
matters instead of dissolving them.</p>

<p>The quantity of water should be kept as low as may be,
in order to have as strong a solution of alkali as possible;
this effects a saving both in the time of boiling, and in the
alkali. This is of great importance where it is necessary to
evaporate the whole of the waste liquors. It should also be
remembered that a certain amount of water is always formed
by condensation in all boilers in which live steam is used.
On the other hand, if too little water be added, the rags are
liable to become “burned” and the fibre therefore weakened.
During the operation the boiler should be made to revolve
slowly, in order to produce thorough circulation of the liquor.</p>

<p>The boiling being completed, the pressure is allowed to
fall, either by cooling or by blowing off from a cock usually
provided for that purpose, and the liquor allowed to collect at
the bottom of the boiler. It is then run off by the cock J
(Fig. 18), and the rags drained as much as possible. Water
is then run in to give the rags a preliminary washing.
If time permits the steam may be turned in and the operation
assisted. After again draining, the rags are withdrawn from
the boiler into any suitable receptacle. A convenient form
is that of a rectangular iron box on wheels, which can be
readily transferred from one part of the
mill to another. <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span></p>

<p>The next process is that of washing. This is usually
performed in a washer or breaker, the construction of which
is shown in Fig. 19.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/i085.png" width="600" height="344" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>

<p>It consists essentially of a rectangular vessel with rounded
ends, in the centre of which, but not
extending the whole <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span>
way, is a partition B, known as the “mid-feather.” The
roll A, which is furnished with a number of steel knives G,
and driven from the wheel H, revolves in one of the compartments
formed by the mid-feather. In this compartment
the floor is inclined in such a way as to bring the pulp well
under the roll, as shown by the dotted line D. Immediately
under the roll is what is called the “bed-plate,” the end of
which is seen at I, extending up to the mid-feather, and
fitted with knives similar to those in the roll A. The
arrangement of the knives, both in the bed-plate and the
roll, is similar to that given in Figs. 33 and 34. The distance
between the roll and the bed-plate can be varied at will by
means of the handle E, which is so arranged as to raise
both ends of the roll simultaneously. In those breakers of
an older pattern, one end only of the roll was raised, and
thus the knives became worn unequally.</p>

<p>After passing between the roll and the bed-plate, the pulp
flows down the “back-fall” D′, and finds its way round to
the other side of the mid-feather. On the inclined part of
the floor, and immediately in front of the bed-plate I, a
small depression is made, covered with an iron grating, for
the purpose of catching buttons, small pieces of stone, and
other heavy substances that may have found their way into
the rags. There is generally a similar grating with rather
finer openings on the other side of the mid-feather. The
engine is constructed of iron, generally made in one casting.</p>

<p>The dirty water from the rags is removed by the “drum-washer”
C. It is divided into compartments by the partitions
shown by the dotted line <i>c</i>. The centre of the drum is
formed of a conical tube, the narrow end of which is towards
the mid-feather. The ends of the drum are generally made
of mahogany, as this is found to stand the action of alkali
better than any other wood. The periphery is covered with
fine copper or brass wire-cloth, laid on to a backing of a
much coarser material. An improved form of backing has
been introduced lately, which is much more durable than
wire. It is formed of brass cut into the
form shown in <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span>
Fig. 20. The drum can be raised or lowered by the small
wheel F, and it is driven by a belt on the shaft that bears
the roll.</p>

<div class="dctr05">
<img src="images/i087.png" width="372" height="409" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
20.</div></div><!--dctr05-->

<p>The wash-water passes through the wire cloth into the
compartments formed by the partitions <i>c</i>, and finding its way
down to the narrow end of the inner conical tube, flows out
through the side of the drum into a trough which is placed
across the washer to receive it. Or it may, as shown in the
drawing, be conducted through the mid-feather itself, which
is made hollow at this part for the purpose.</p>

<p>Another form of drum-washer, called the siphon-washer,
is sometimes used. Its construction will be understood by
reference to Figs. 21 and 22.</p>

<p>The drum is simply a hollow cylinder of wire cloth, the
ends of which are formed of wood. Inside the cylinder is
the siphon tube A, into which the water passing through the
wire cloth flows. The continuation of the siphon tube B
(Fig. 22) is made of flexible tubing. The action of the
siphon is commenced by filling it with water through the
cock C (Fig. 22). The water then flows in the direction
indicated by the arrows. The tube A is fixed, and passes
through a hollow journal fitted on to the end
of the drum. <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span>
The other end is connected with the rod E, on which the
driving pulley D is placed.</p>

<div class="dctr01">

<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
22.</div></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>The water passing through the wire cloth on the drum
carries with it a certain amount of fibre which, unless special
precautions are taken (see “Save-all,” p. <a href="#p154" title="go to p. 154">154</a>) is lost. The
amount is considerable in the case of weak rags, and care
should therefore be taken that the washing is not prolonged
more than is consistent with proper cleansing, and that the
pulp should not be too much broken up at this stage.</p>

<p>The washed and broken pulp goes by the
name of “half-stuff.” <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span></p>

<p>The following is the usual plan of treating rags in the
washer:—It is first half-filled with water, and the rags from
the boiler put in gradually until nearly filled. Water is now
allowed to flow in at the opposite end to where the drum-washer
is placed. This, by the action of the roll, mixes
thoroughly with the pulp and extracts all the soluble matter,
and also carries with it fine insoluble impurities.</p>

<p>The action of the knives in the roll on the rags passing
between it and the knives in the bed-plate serves to break
them up and thoroughly disintegrate them. The dirty
water then passes away through the drum-washer, the stream
of pure water being regulated so as to keep the level
constant. This is continued until only pure water passes
away. The supply is then stopped, the washer still being
kept in action. As the level falls the drum is lowered by
means of the handle F. When sufficiently drained the pulp
is discharged through a valve in the bottom of the engine.
It is now ready to be bleached. This may be done in
separate engines called “potchers,” somewhat resembling
the breaker or washer already described, or it may be done
in the breaker itself. The process of bleaching will be
described in Chapter VII.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the bleaching process is conducted in the
“beater” itself, but this is not to be recommended.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Esparto.</h3>—This
fibre, on account of its high percentage
of non-cellulose constituents, requires a large amount of
soda to resolve it; on the other hand, being of the nature
of a pecto-cellulose, the process of disintegration may be
conducted at a low pressure; in fact, it is the practice at
some mills to boil in open vessels, in which case, however, a
larger amount of soda is required. As has been already
stated, it may be taken as a general rule for all fibres,
that within certain limits the higher the pressure employed
the less soda is required. The quantity necessary
also varies with the district from which the grass comes.
Caustic soda is the chemical invariably employed; lime, on
account of its forming insoluble
compounds with the <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span>
non-cellulose portion of the grass, is inapplicable. Not only does
the amount of soda depend upon the pressure, but it also
depends to a considerable extent on the form of boiler employed.
The use of rotary boilers is objectionable, as the
esparto tends to collect together into compact masses, which
are with difficulty penetrated by the liquor. It is therefore
the almost universal practice to employ stationary boilers.</div>

<div class="section">
<p>The first treatment that the esparto undergoes is that of
“picking.” The bands of the bales in which esparto is
packed, generally by hydraulic pressure, are cut, and the
grass is spread out on tables by women, who carefully remove
such impurities as weeds, root-ends, &#x26;c., which from their
nature are with great difficulty boiled and bleached, and
which if not removed would be liable to appear in the
finished paper as dark-coloured specks, technically known
as “sheave.” This treatment is called “dry-picking,” in
contradistinction to a subsequent process, known as “wet-picking.”
A portion of the table is covered with coarse wire
gauze, through which when the grass is spread over it loose
particles of sand, dirt, &#x26;c., escape. The cleaning of esparto
can be much better ac­com­plished by means of machinery.
Fig. 23 is an elevation of a machine manufactured for the
purpose by Messrs. Masson, Scott and Bertram. The grass,
which may be in the form of sheaves, as taken from the bales,
is put in by the hopper A. It passes thence
to a conical <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
drum made of steel bars placed very close together, driven
rapidly by the shaft B. It is provided with five rows of
teeth. Fixed to the sides of the willow there is also a row of
stationary teeth. The grass is thoroughly broken up and
dusted by the action of the teeth, and is transferred to the
wide end of the willow at C, where it is carried forward
on the travelling tables D. During its passage along the
tables it can be examined and picked by women standing on
the platforms E. The dust and dirt passing through the
steel bars of the drum are drawn away by a fan through the
pipe F.</p>

<p>This machine is also adapted so as to carry the cleaned
grass to the boiler-house. It is taken forward by means of
travelling rakes over the tops of a series of boilers, any one
of which can be furnished by simply opening a door corresponding
in position with the lid of the boiler.</p>

<p><i>Boiling.</i>—The
ordinary form of boiler is shown in Fig. 24.
It is known as a vomiting boiler. The grass is put in
by the door E, which is hinged, and is counterbalanced
by the weights L. It is securely fastened down by the
screws F. Steam enters by the inner pipe A, which dips a
little below the perforated false bottom B. Surrounding
the steam-pipe is a wider pipe C, open at the top, which is
made slightly trumpet-shaped; also open at the bottom,
where it ends in a kind of shoulder, on which the false
bottom rests. The lower part has two or more openings G
cut away, through which the liquor can freely pass.</p>

<p>In order to get as large a charge into the boiler as possible,
steam is turned on while furnishing, and a quantity of
caustic soda lye is also run in, which has the effect of
softening the grass and making it more compact. This is
continued until the boiler is well filled.</p>

<p>The action of the boiler is as follows:—The steam passing
through the pipe A heats the liquor that has drained from
the grass through the perforations in the false bottom, and
forcing it up the wide pipe C, causes it to strike against the
dome or bonnet D, and distribute itself again
over the grass. <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>
This is technically known as “vomiting.” In this way a
constant circulation of liquor is kept up.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/i092.png" width="600" height="684" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
24.</div></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>The boiler is emptied by the door H and the liquor is run
off by the cock I. The boilers are usually supplied with a
safety valve E, and also with a pipe for letting off the steam
when the boiling is finished. The boiling generally takes
from four to six hours. The quantity of soda necessary
depends upon the nature of the grass, Spanish requiring less
than African. <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span></p>

<p>Routledge, to whom the introduction of esparto as a paper-making
material is due, gives 10 per cent. as the proper
quantity.</p>

<p>The pressures employed vary from 5 lb. to 45 lb. There
has been a growing tendency of late to employ the higher
pressures for reasons already stated.</p>

<div class="dctr04">
<img src="images/i093.png" width="488" height="569" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
25.</div></div><!--dctr04-->

<p>Of late years great improvements in the form of the
boiler have been introduced. Fig. 25 is an illustration of
Roeckner’s Patent Boiler. The vomit pipe is outside the
boiler. Steam entering by the cock D, forces the liquor up
the vertical vomit pipe and distributes it over the grass. The
pipe K is used for heating the liquor at the commencement of
the operation by means of waste steam. F F are gauges for
indicating the height of the liquor. The grass is put in by
the opening G. The pipes A B and C are for
the supply of <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span>
steam, strong lye and water. The boiled grass is discharged
by the circular door E.</p>

<p>The boiler holds three tons of grass
and the boiling is completed in about
2&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>
hours, the pressure being about 35–40 lb. per square inch. It
is claimed that by its use a saving both of time and soda is
effected.</p>

<div class="dctr03">
<img src="images/i094.png" width="523" height="845" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
26.</div></div><!--dctr03-->

<p>Sinclair’s Patent Boiler is shown in Fig. 26. The vomit
pipes, of which there are two, are made of
thin steel plates <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
riveted to opposite sides of the boiler. The liquor drains
through the perforated false bottom, and is then forced up
the vomit pipes above the perforated plates through which
it is distributed over the grass in a number of fine jets. The
boiler is charged by the door <i>e</i> and emptied by <i>j</i>. The small
cock <i>a</i> is used as a blow-through cock; the opening <i>b</i> is used
for blowing-off steam when emptying the boiler; <i>c</i> for letting
in caustic soda lye; <i>d</i> for water. Steam enters by the small
branch of the T pipe at the bottom of the boiler, the other, <i>g</i>
being used for running off the waste liquor. A boiler holds
from two to three tons of grass, and a boiling is completed in
about two hours at a pressure of 40–50 lb. per square inch.</p>

<p>The two forms of boiler above described possess the obvious
advantage of having the whole or nearly the whole of the
interior available for holding grass; the boilers can therefore
be made to hold more, and the boiling is moreover much more
evenly ac­com­plished.</p>

<p><i>Washing.</i>—The
boiling being completed, the steam is
allowed to escape and the liquor to collect at the bottom of
the boiler where it is run away by the pipes placed at the
bottom for the purpose. Water is then run in and steam
turned on for a short time; this is also run off, and the grass
drained as completely as possible. The boiled grass is then
emptied into trucks and taken away to the washing engines.
These resemble those already described under rags.</p>

<p>During the process of washing, a certain amount of the
shorter fibres find their way through the meshes of the wire-cloth.
In addition to this a large proportion of the cellular
tissue surrounding the fibro-vascular bundles (see Fig. 12,
p. <a href="#p057" title="go to p. 57">57</a>) is carried away. If the wash-water be examined
under the microscope, it will be seen to consist largely of
this cellular matter. Though this entails a certain loss of
cellulose, its removal is in other respects advantageous, as it
is possessed of hardly any “felting” properties, and it is
moreover exceedingly difficult to bleach.</p>

<p>The amount of fibre actually obtained in practice is but
little below that contained in the grass. A
certain loss is <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span>
inevitable, but this probably does not exceed 1 or 2 per
cent.</p>

<p>The percentage of cellulose in esparto is given on p. <a href="#p057" title="go to p. 57">57</a>.
The following numbers obtained by the authors are somewhat
higher. They are calculated on the absolutely dry
fibre; those mentioned are on the <i>air-dry</i> <span class="nowrap">samples:—</span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that considerable differences occur even
between different specimens of the same kind of grass.</p>

<p>It is the practice in some mills to wash the grass in a series
of tanks connected together in the same way as the lixiviating
tanks of an alkali works. They are so arranged that pure
water flows in at one end, passes through fresh lots of
grass in succession, and issues at the further end highly
charged with the soluble products of the grass. By such an
arrangement the grass can be washed without any loss of
fibre, and with a minimum quantity of water. This latter
feature is of great importance in mills where it is necessary
to evaporate the whole of the waste liquors from the esparto,
as they are then obtained in a very concentrated form. Even
with such an arrangement it is advisable to give the grass a
short final treatment in the washing engine.</p>

<p>The washing having been completed, and the esparto
having been broken up into “half-stuff,” it is now ready to be
bleached (see Chap. VII.).</p>

<p>The presse-pâte system, originally adopted for the treatment
of straw, has of late years been extensively applied to
esparto.</p>

<p>The presse-pâte consists of the wet end of a paper machine,
and is furnished with sand-tables and strainers. The pulp is
allowed to flow on to the wire cloth, so as to form a thick
web of pulp. The bulk of the water passes away through
the wire cloth; a further quantity is
removed by the <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span>
vacuum-boxes and couch-rolls. The pulp, containing from 50 to 60
per cent. of water, is wound round an iron rod until a sufficiently
large roll is formed.</p>

<p>The advantages of the presse-pâte system are the possibility
of the removal of dirt and unboiled portions by means of the
sand-tables and strainers, and the very complete washing and
removal of the products of the action of bleaching powder.</p>

<p>It also enables manufacturers to dispense with the somewhat
costly methods of dry and wet picking.</p>

<p>The presse-pâte system can also be applied to the unbleached
pulp.</p>

<p>It may be interesting at this point to say something about
the substances which are removed from the esparto by the
caustic soda. On referring to p. <a href="#p057" title="go to p. 57">57</a> it will be seen that the
original grass contains nearly half its weight of extractive
matter, the removal of which has to be effected. Only a
small proportion of this is extractive matter in the ordinary
sense of the term, i.e. that can be extracted by the usual
solvents; the remainder is intimately combined with the
cellulose. The action of the caustic soda is to resolve these
bodies, the cellulose remaining behind, and the other constituents
being dissolved as resinous bodies by the soda. A
certain proportion of the mineral constituents, notably the
silica, dissolves in the lye, the latter forming silicate of soda.</p>

<p>On neutralizing the liquor with an acid, the bulk of the
dissolved constituents is thrown down as a dark brown
resinous mass. If this crude product be purified, it is found
to consist of a definite body having the formula C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.
By the action of chlorine on this resin a bright yellow
chlorine compound is formed, resembling the compound from
jute described on p. <a href="#p018" title="go to p. 18">18</a>. If the resin be treated with concentrated
nitric acid, a bright yellow body is formed, which
forms definite compounds with bases, and which has the
property of dyeing animal fibres a bright orange colour. In
addition to this body, a yellowish-white wax can be isolated.
It sometimes happens that this wax is but imperfectly dissolved
in the caustic lye; if the waste
liquor be allowed <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span>
to stand, the wax is occasionally found to collect in small
quantities on the surface.</p>

<p>Various attempts have been made from time to time
to remove from the waste liquors the soluble matter derived
from the esparto by the addition of lime. This throws it
down as a very voluminous precipitate, exceeding difficult of
filtration. The filtrate contains only caustic soda. The
difficulties of removal of the precipitate, however, are almost
insurmountable. The usual method of disposing of the
liquor is to evaporate it to dryness and ignite it, as will be
subsequently described under the head of “Soda Recovery,”
Chapter XII.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Straw.</h3>—Straw
very closely resembles esparto in its chemical
constitution; it is, however, more highly lignified, and for
this reason (see p. <a href="#p063" title="go to p. 63">63</a>) requires a more drastic treatment for
its resolution. It is therefore usual to treat straw with
rather larger quantities of caustic, and generally at high
pressures. It is possible, however, to resolve it at 5–10 lbs.
pressure, but the resulting pulp is more difficult to bleach,
and can only be used for inferior kinds of paper. In treating
straw for use in high-class paper, it is necessary to boil
under such conditions that even the knots, which are much
less readily attacked, shall be so far disintegrated that they
may be bleached with a moderate quantity of bleaching
powder. Such a treatment, on the other hand, involves a
diminished yield of pulp, and at the same time a somewhat
weakened fibre.</div>

<p>The kinds of straw in general use are wheat, oat, rye, and
barley; the two first constituting the bulk of the raw
material, at least in this country. Some idea of the composition
of straw may be gathered from the analyses given
on p. <a href="#p059" title="go to p. 59">59</a>.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the amount of cellulose is quite as
high as in esparto, but for the reasons above given and from
the fact that a large proportion of the cellulose consists of
cellular tissue (see Figs. 12 and 13), which is easily attacked

<p>The yield of pulp is greatly influenced by the conditions
under which it is obtained; high pressures and temperatures
exerting considerable influence on the result. This is
probably the case with straw more than any other fibre,
on account of the physical and chemical nature of the
cellulose. It is doubtful whether much more than 35 per
cent. is actually obtained in practice.</p>

<p>Straw is usually boiled in cylindrical rotary boilers.
Some paper-makers, however, prefer to use one or other of
the different forms of vomiting boilers already described.</p>

<p>The use of a rotary boiler is open to certain objections.
In the first place, it is doubtful if they are as economical
of soda as the vomiting boilers, especially the more recent
patterns; and, secondly, the rotation of the boiler so disintegrates
the pulp, that a certain proportion of the cellulose,
especially those fibres which are short, is liable to be lost
during the subsequent treatment. It seems probable that
the best results would be obtained if the rotation of the
boiler were reduced to a minimum, in fact, sufficient only to
produce thorough circulation of the liquor.</p>

<p>The proportion of soda necessary to boil straw thoroughly
is, for reasons already stated, greater than is the case with
esparto. The amount varies from 10 to 20 per cent. on the
raw material. <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span></p>

<p>The different processes to which straw is subjected vary
greatly. The following may be taken as a general indication
of the methods employed. The straw is usually cut into
short pieces of about 1–2 in. in length by means of an
ordinary chaff-cutter. The cut straw is carried by means of
a blast of air along a wooden tube or shaft into a chamber,
the sides of which are made of coarse iron gauze. This
chamber is itself inclosed in another chamber, in which the
dust and dirt accompanying the straw collect. The clean
straw is then placed in sacks and conveyed to the boiler-house.</p>

<p>Owing to the bulky nature of straw, it is difficult to get
a large charge into a boiler at one operation; it is therefore
usual, after having filled it as completely as possible, to run
in a portion of the lye required, and to turn on the steam for
a few minutes. This has the effect of so far softening the
straw as to make it lie closely at the bottom of the boiler
and to allow of a further quantity being put in. This having
been ac­com­plished, the remainder of the lye required is run
in, together with the requisite quantity of water, and the
steam turned on. The pressure may vary from 10 to 50, or
even 80 lbs. per sq. in., and the time from 4–8 hours.</p>

<p>When the boiler has sufficiently cooled, the charge is run
out by a cock in the bottom. Owing to the rotary action
of the boiler the straw is in the state of fine pulp, having
been almost completely disintegrated; so fine, in fact,
that it flows readily through a 3-in. pipe. It is run
into large tanks with perforated tile bottoms, where the
excess of liquor is allowed to drain away and the pulp washed
by the addition of water. It is then dug out and taken to
be bleached. Before this is done, however, it may be necessary
to give it a further washing. This may be done in the
potcher itself. Instead of washing the straw in tanks, it
may be washed in an ordinary washing engine, such as has
been already described. Owing to the finely divided state
of the pulp, however, this method, unless the meshes of the
wire-cloth covering the drum washer are
very fine, entails <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
a considerable loss of fibre. It is more suitable in cases in
which the straw has been boiled in stationary boilers, and
in which therefore it is less disintegrated. When stationary
boilers are employed, it is not necessary to cut the straw
very fine; in fact, it is sometimes put into the boiler whole.
The cutting has this advantage, that it loosens the adhering
dirt. In cases where the action of the soda has not been
carried far, or when the straw has been put into the boiler
whole, the pulp will not be disintegrated to the same
extent, and it would not flow through a narrow pipe. It is
necessary therefore to discharge the boiler through the doors
used for filling.</p>

<p>A novel form of washer especially adapted for straw,
whereby the washing is effected with the minimum quantity
of water, has been used on the Continent to a considerable
extent, and to some extent in this country. The pulp is
caused to pass along a series of revolving cones covered with
wire-cloth, through which the liquor escapes. As it reaches
the end of each cone, the pulp is emptied into a small tank
containing water from the cones further on in the series.
It is carried forward by means of hollow bent arms connected
with the inside of the next cone, which then discharges it
at the other end, to be again carried forward.</p>

<p>As already stated, the presse-pâte system is largely
adopted for straw pulp; it has been described under Esparto.
It may sometimes be employed with advantage before
bleaching, though it is generally used after.</p>

<p>A method of treating straw is sometimes adopted which
produces a pulp of higher quality than is obtainable by the
ordinary method. The washed pulp is mixed in a chest
provided with stirrers, with a large quantity of water, and
is then pumped into another chest placed at a higher level,
from which it flows between a pair of hard granite millstones,
the surfaces of which are cut into radial grooves.
The stones are fixed horizontally, and are made to revolve
at a very rapid rate. During the passage of the pulp through
the stones, the knots, weeds, and other hard
portions of the <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
straw which may have resisted the action of the alkali are
reduced to a fine state of division, and are thus more readily
acted upon in the subsequent operation of bleaching. The
degree of fineness to which the pulp is reduced can be
determined by regulating its flow and the distance between
the stones. Pulp produced in this way is of a very even character,
and is comparatively free from unbleached particles.</p>

<p>Within the last few years a process of treating straw has
been introduced which, on account of the high quality of
the pulp produced, has attracted considerable attention from
paper-makers. It consists in exposing pulp obtained in the
usual way by the action of caustic soda to the action of
chlorine gas. The method was patented in England on
March 3rd, 1880 (No. 938), by Friedrich Carl Glaser. The
amount of soda in the preliminary boiling is reduced much
below that necessary for perfect pulping, the result being
that the cellulose is much less liable to be destroyed, and
thus a greater yield is obtained. The pulp is thoroughly
washed and partially freed from moisture in a centrifugal
machine until only about 70 per cent. remains. The partially
dried pulp is then exposed in leaden or stone chambers for
some hours in an atmosphere of chlorine, produced by the
action of hydrochloric acid upon manganese dioxide. By
the action of the chlorine, those portions of the straw which
have been but imperfectly acted upon by the caustic soda in
the boiling process are completely disintegrated, or, rather,
are rendered more susceptible to the action of the bleaching
liquor employed subsequently. The consequence is that
when bleaching liquor is added, the whole of the straw
is rapidly reduced to the state of pure cellulose, and the
finished product is remarkably free from anything like unbleached
portions. Owing to the fact that the action of the
caustic is minimised, a considerable proportion of the more
easily degraded cellulose survives, and the yield of pulp is
thereby increased. The process is, however, necessarily
expensive. The action of the chlorine will be readily understood
by a reference to p. <a href="#p019" title="go to p. 19">19</a>. <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span></p>

<p>Owing to the fact that a considerable proportion of the
pulp obtained from straw consists of cellular tissue (see
Fig. 13, p. <a href="#p058" title="go to p. 58">58</a>), which, although cellulose, is devoid of
fibrous structure, paper made from straw only is found to
be much weaker than that made from fibres such as esparto.
On the other hand, being a cheap material, and one capable
of yielding a very white pulp with a moderate quantity of
bleach, it is held in considerable repute by many paper-makers,
especially as a material for mixing with esparto.
It is sometimes mixed with cotton and linen rags, even in
the finest qualities of paper.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Jute, Manilla,
Adansonia, &#x26;c.</h3>—The boiling processes already
described under Esparto and Straw are, with certain slight
modifications, equally applicable to fibres of this class.
For convenience in manipulation they are usually cut into
small pieces by a machine such as is shown in Fig. 16, and
are then cleaned and dusted in a willowing machine. The
boiling process calls for no special notice beyond what has
been already said with regard to other fibres.</div>

<p>A cheaper method, and one which is largely adopted in
mills where only a coarse dark-coloured paper is required,
consists in boiling the jute or other fibre in lime. Such a
treatment is, however, not so effective as one in which
caustic soda is used, and the fibre produced is harder and
coarser in every way. The yield of pulp, however, owing to
the fact that the fibre is imperfectly resolved, is greater.
In many cases, from questions of economy, lime may be
advantageously employed.</p>

<p>Jute can only be employed successfully when it is imperfectly
resolved, that is to say, when it is not reduced to the
state of pure cellulose. In such a state it forms a comparatively
weak fibre, owing to the fact that it is resolved into
its individual fibres. If the filaments are not completely
resolved, then a strong fibre is the result, but in this case,
the pulp cannot be obtained in a pure white state. Owing
to this fact, jute has had up to the present only a limited
consumption, except for the manufacture
of coarse papers. <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span>
Jute and Adansonia are largely used for papers where
strength is of more importance than appearance, such, for
example, as paper for telegram forms, strong wrapping
paper, &#x26;c.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Wood.</h3>—The
processes for treating wood have already
been described in Chapter V.</div>

<p>When an alkaline treatment is adopted, the alkali employed
is, at least in this country, caustic soda. In Germany
the sulphide of sodium processes have been very largely
adopted. The alkali method is, however, being superseded
by the more perfect and more economical method of treatment
with sulphurous acid or acid sulphites.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">“Broke”
Paper.</h3>—Under this head may be included all the
partially formed paper which is always obtained in greater
or less degree when a paper-machine is started, or such
portions as are occasionally unavoidably damaged in its
passage over the drying cylinders, together with the
imperfect or rejected portions. It may also include used or
waste paper, a large proportion of which, if not too dirty,
is re-made into paper. The cleaner portions, especially if
they have not been dried, are frequently returned direct to
the beaters, and mixed with other pulp. That which has been
actually made into paper requires to be softened by boiling
in water and <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span>
gentle breaking in an engine. It may be necessary to heat
it for a short time in a weak solution of caustic soda.
This may be done either in a breaker or in special tanks
provided for the purpose. Paper which has been printed upon
requires a rather more drastic treatment, and it must of
course be used for an inferior quality of paper, as it is
impossible to get it to as good a colour as the original
pulp from which it was made—at least not economically.
“Broke” paper may be advantageously disintegrated by means
of an edge-runner. It consists of a pair of stones arranged
in the same way as an ordinary mortar-mill (Fig. 27).</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Mechanical Wood
Pulp.</h3>—A very large quantity of pulp is used in the
commoner kinds of paper, such as cheap news, &#x26;c.,
which is obtained by disintegrating wood by mechanical
means alone, no chemicals being employed. The idea of
making paper in this way dates back about 100 years, but
owing to the want of suitable machinery it is only lately
that a good product has been obtained. The following
are, in a general way, the details of the process
<span class="nowrap">employed:—</span></div>

<p>The wood is first cut up into blocks, the size of which
is determined by the width of the stones used for grinding;
any knots present are cut out with an axe. The stones are
made of sandstone, and are covered over three quadrants
with an iron casing, the remaining quadrant being exposed.
The surfaces of the stones are made rough by the pressure
of a steel roll studded with points, and which is pressed
against it while revolving. In addition to this, channels
about <sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub> in. deep
are cut into the stone at distances of 2–3 in. They are
made in two sets, crossing each other in the centre of the
stone, and serve to carry off the pulp to the sides of the
stone, in addition to giving increased grinding-surface.
The pressure of the blocks of wood against the stones is
steadily maintained by screws worked by suitable gearing;
this is necessary in order to obtain a pulp of uniform
character. A stream of water is kept constantly playing on
the stone; by this means, the pulp as fast as it is formed
can be conveniently carried away. It is first passed <span
class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span> through a rake, which
retains small pieces of wood that have escaped grinding.
The stream of pulp then passes through the sorters, the
object of which is to keep back such portions of the wood
as have not been sufficiently disintegrated. These consist
of cylinders about 3 ft. long and 2 ft. in diameter,
covered with a coarse wire-cloth. The fibres that are
retained by this wire fall into the refiners, which consist
of a couple of horizontal cylinders of sandstone, the upper
one only of which revolves. Here they are further <span
class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span> disintegrated, and are
again passed through the wire-cloth; this is repeated until
all the fibres have passed through. The pulp, after passing
through the first sorter, may be conducted through a series
of gradually increasing fineness, and, by this means, be
separated into different qualities. Though pulp so prepared
cannot compete with chemically-prepared stuff, as the
fibres are extremely short, and have comparatively little
felting-power, it may be used with advantage as a sort of
filling-material.</p>

<div class="dctr05">

<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
28.</div></div><!--dctr05-->

<p>Various modifications of the foregoing process have from
time to time been proposed; among others, that of softening
the wood by previous soaking in water, or steaming,
seems to be valuable, as by so doing, it is highly probable
that a longer fibre could be obtained, the soft wood being
more readily torn away by the stones. Some inventors have
proposed to replace the sandstone by an artificial stone containing
a large quantity of emery.</p>

<p>An improved method of preparing mechanical wood pulp,
lately patented by Mr. A. L. Thune, of Christiania, has been
communicated to us by Mr. Carl Christensen.</p>

<p>The apparatus employed is shown in Figs. 28, 29, and 30.
Fig. 28 illustrates an arrangement of grinding apparatus
fixed direct on to a turbine. The stone is fastened on
to the shaft S worked by the turbine T. The wood in the
form of small blocks is kept in contact with the stone
by a number of hydraulic presses P. <span class="xxpn"

<p>The ground and sorted pulp is made into thick sheets by
means of the board machine shown in Fig. 31. The pulp
mixed with water passes down the shoot D into the vat B
in which the cylinder K revolves. This cylinder is covered
with wire-cloth, and as it revolves it takes with it a certain
quantity of pulp in the form of a continuous sheet.
This sheet is taken on to the endless travelling felt F by the
small couch roll E. When it reaches the rolls C it is
wound round the upper one, from which it is removed when
a sufficient thickness is obtained. Obtained in this form the
pulp is readily transported.</p>

<p>The woods commonly employed are white pine and aspen.
The latter yields a pulp of a better colour, but of inferior
strength than the former.</p>

<p>Paper containing mechanical wood pulp is very liable
to become discoloured by the action of air and light,
the ligno-celluloses being much more readily acted upon
than the celluloses isolated from them. Such fibre is,
moreover, devoid of much felting power; it has, in fact,
little to recommend it but its comparative cheapness.
It is nevertheless used in large quantities, some cheap
papers being made entirely from it. <span class="xxpn"

<span class="hsmall">
 BLEACHING.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">The methods of bleaching being essentially the same for all
pulps, it will only be necessary to describe one in detail.</p>

<p>The process depends upon the use of a solution of calcium
hypochlorite, prepared by dissolving bleaching powder in
water. This solution is best prepared in a vessel provided
with stirrers or agitators, whereby a thorough mixture of
the bleaching powder and water is obtained. Bleaching
powder always contains a certain amount of free lime
and calcium carbonate, which remain undissolved in the
water. This should be allowed to settle to the bottom of
the vessel, and the clear liquor run off. The residue may
then be again treated with water, or with weak liquor obtained
by washing the residue. If the washings are too
weak to be conveniently used for bleaching, they may be
stored in a separate tank and used for dissolving fresh powder.
In this way a strong stock solution can be readily prepared,
the powder at the same time being thoroughly exhausted.
The washing should be repeated as frequently as possible,
after which the residue may be allowed to drain. This
operation is best conducted on a filter bed provided with
an air-pump similar to that described in Chapter XII. The
residue is obtained in this way as a hard cake, containing
about 60 per cent. of water. If the above operations have
been properly conducted, it should not contain more than
about 0·25 per cent. of chlorine.</p>

<p>The original powder should contain from 33·0 to 35·0 per
cent. of “available chlorine,” that is, chlorine which is effective
in
the bleaching process. <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span></p>

<p>Owing to the ease with which it decomposes it should be
kept cool and not exposed to the air.</p>

<p>If possible, one or more large store tanks should be provided
for the strong bleach liquor, so that time may be
given for the complete separation of the insoluble portions.
The liquor can be drawn off with a “siphon” pipe without
disturbing the residue.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance that only clear liquor be
used, as a milky solution of calcium hypochlorite is much
more sluggish in its action than one which is perfectly
clear and bright.</p>

<p>A convenient strength for the stock solution is 6°&#x2005;Twaddle:
this corresponds to about half a pound of bleaching powder
to the gallon.</p>

<p>The method of testing the powder and its solution will be
described in Chapter XIV.</p>

<p>The washed and broken pulp is placed in the “potcher”
together with the necessary quantity of bleaching liquor
and as much water as is required to produce complete circulation
of the mass. In many mills the breaker itself
answers the purpose of a potcher also. The quantity of
water should be kept as low as possible, as it is found that
by the use of strong solutions less bleaching powder is
required than with weak solutions; moreover, less time is
required to produce the effect. On the other hand, with very
strong solutions, the pulp is liable to be injuriously affected.</p>

<p>Straw and esparto pulps are sometimes bleached in large
potchers made of brick covered with cement. The circulation
of the pulp is produced by the action of paddles made
of wood or, preferably, of iron.</p>

<p>Many “potchers” are provided with steam pipes, whereby
the mass of pulp and liquor is heated. This should be done
with great care, so as to avoid superheating in any part, as
this is certain to cause destruction of the fibre. The better
plan, where it can be adopted, is to uniformly heat the pulp
before running in the bleach.</p>

<p>In certain cases the action of the
calcium hypochlorite is <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span>
assisted and accelerated by the addition of either sulphuric
or hydrochloric acids; these combine with the lime and
liberate hypochlorous acid, which has a more rapid action
than its calcium salt. If the acid be added in too large
quantity, or of too great a strength, it sometimes happens
that instead of hypochlorous acid, chlorine gas is given off,
part of which escapes into the air, thus causing loss. Moreover,
the chlorine is liable to enter into combination with
the fibre substance forming the yellow chlorination products
described on p. <a href="#p018" title="go to p. 18">18</a>.</p>

<p>This liability is greater in the case of highly lignified
fibres, such as wood or jute: in these cases, therefore, the use
of acids should be avoided. When used the acid should be
largely diluted with water and added gradually. The best
plan is to allow the action of the bleach to continue for some
time, only adding the acid when it is nearly exhausted. In
this way risk of damage to the pulp is avoided.</p>

<p>The diluted acid should be conveyed by a leaden pipe
passing down to the floor of the potcher, and perforated at
its lower extremity.</p>

<p>Other means of accelerating the action of the bleaching
powder have been suggested, such, for example, as the use of
bicarbonate of soda, which by double decomposition forms
with the bleaching powder carbonate of lime and free hypochlorous
acid. It is, however, much too expensive an agent.</p>

<p>The amount of bleaching powder necessary to produce a
good white colour differs materially with the fibre to be
bleached, and of course with the degree of resolution of the
fibre substance in the preliminary treatment with caustic
soda.</p>

<p>The following numbers may be taken to be approximations
of the amount necessary to bleach well-boiled <span class="nowrap">pulps:—</span></p>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span></div>

<p>A well-boiled pulp should contain from 90 to 95 per cent.
of cellulose.</p>

<p>Very excellent results are sometimes obtained by substituting
sodium hypochlorite for the calcium compound.
This is done by decomposing a solution of bleaching powder
with an equivalent quantity of either sodium sulphate or
sodium carbonate. The precipitate of calcium sulphate or
carbonate is allowed to settle and the clear liquor run off.
Such a solution is more sluggish in its action than one of
calcium hypochlorite, but it is more easily controlled, and is
less liable to injure any material treated with it.</p>

<p>The time necessary to produce a perfect bleach depends
on the nature and condition of the pulp, on the degree of
concentration of the liquor, and on the temperature at which
the operation is conducted. Some paper-makers prefer to
extend the bleaching over a considerable period of time,
but this involves the employment of a larger system of
“potchers,” which in many instances is an objection. If
this method is adopted, especially in the case of straw or
esparto, the action of the paddles or roll should be stopped,
as otherwise the fibres are liable to felt together in the form
of small grains, which sometimes escape the action of the
beating roll, and occasionally find their way into the paper,
causing an unevenness of surface. By giving longer time
to the bleaching there is less risk of damage to the fibre, and
consequently a greater yield of bleached pulp.</p>

<p>The action of the bleaching solution should, as far as
possible, be confined to the non-cellulose portions of the
fibre. A certain action on the cellulose itself invariably
takes place, but it should be reduced to a minimum. The
action of bleach upon cellulose has been indicated in Chapter
I., p. <a href="#p010" title="go to p. 10">10</a>. For further information on this subject the reader
is referred to the ‘Journal of the Society of Chemical
Industry,’ 1884, April 29 and May 29.</p>

<p>A very good method of bleaching consists in a preliminary
treatment in the ordinary way in the potcher, followed by a
prolonged
steeping in tanks. <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span></p>

<p>In the case of pulps which are very difficult to bleach, the
action can be greatly assisted by washing out the products of
the bleaching action, treating the pulp for a short time with
a weak alkaline solution, again washing, and then repeating
the bleaching process. In this way very refractory pulps
can easily be bleached. Even an intermediate washing with
water is useful.</p>

<p>In most cases, where a fairly good colour has been obtained
by the use of bleaching powder alone, the colour is
greatly improved by a souring or treatment with weak
hydrochloric acid, or, better still, with solution of sulphurous
acid.</p>

<p>Or the bleaching may be conducted in two or more operations
with intermediate treatments with acid.</p>

<p>All these modifications, however, are more or less troublesome,
and should only be resorted to when the ordinary
method fails.</p>

<p>After bleaching, a certain quantity of calcium hypochlorite
always remains in the pulp. It may be removed in
the potcher itself, or when the pulp reaches the beater. In
any case, the methods adopted are the same. (See p.
<a href="#p127" title="go to p. 127">127</a>.)</p>

<p>In some mills it is the practice to free the bleached pulp
from the products of the decomposition of the bleach by
pressing the pulp in hydraulic presses, or by draining in
vats provided with perforated bottoms. Or the pulp may be
made to pass through a pulp-saver (see Fig. 52, p.
<a href="#p155" title="go to p. 155">155</a>.)</p>

<p>Chlorine gas as a bleaching agent has been almost entirely
superseded by the more manageable calcium hypochlorite.
Its employment is open to the serious objection
indicated before, viz. the liability to form difficultly removable
chlorine compounds. Its use as a disintegrating agent
has already been alluded to (see p. <a href="#p102" title="go to p. 102">102</a>).</p>

<p>A process has lately been invented (English patent,
No. 11,333, 1884), by Prof. Lunge, which involves the use of
acetic acid. The quantity required is, however, very small, as
during the process of bleaching it becomes regenerated. The
free lime in the bleaching powder solution
should first be <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span>
nearly neutralised with a cheaper acid, such as hydrochloric
or sulphuric, followed then by the addition of the acetic acid.
This process, we are informed, gives excellent results with
high-class material, such as the best cotton and linen rags;
it is, however, not to be recommended for such materials as
straw or esparto.</p>

<p>For the bleaching of rags the process invented by
Thompson (English patent, No. 595, 1883) has proved very
effective. The method consists in saturating the material
with a weak solution of bleaching powder, and then exposing
them to the action of carbonic acid gas. In this way
the bleaching action is made very rapid and effective.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Electrolytic
Bleaching.</h3>—Various attempts have from time to time
been made to bleach by means of electricity—that is to
say, by means of the products of the electrolysis of
solutions of alkaline chlorides and the chlorides of the
alkaline earths. The only process which has been to any
extent developed is that of M. Hermite. This process is
based upon the electrolysis of a solution of magnesium
chloride, this salt having been found to give the most
economical results. The solution, at a strength of about
2·5 per cent. of the anhydrous salt (MgCl<sub>2</sub>),
is electrolysed until it contains the equivalent of about
3·0 grms. chlorine per litre. This solution is then run
into the “poacher” containing the pulp to be bleached; a
continuous stream is then kept up, the excess being removed
by means of a drum-washer. This excess, which after being
in contact with the pulp in the engine is more or less
deprived of its bleaching properties, is then returned to
the electrolysing vat, where it is again brought up to the
normal strength.</div>

<p>The electrolysing vat consists of a rectangular vessel of
slate or other suitable material. The negative electrode may
be constructed of zinc; for the positive it is necessary to
employ platinum.</p>

<p>The electrolysed solution has been found to possess very
remarkable properties, which have considerable bearing upon
the economy of the process. If a solution be
taken of equal <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span>
oxidising efficiency with one of calcium hypochlorite, as indicated
by the arsenious acid test (see p. <a href="#p206" title="go to p. 206">206</a>), it is found that
the former possesses greater <i>bleaching</i> efficiency than the latter
in the proportion of 5 to 3. Moreover, the bleaching is much
more rapid, and the loss of weight which the substances
undergo is less, for equal degrees of whiteness obtained.</p>

<p>It has been shown that by the electrolytic method the
bleaching of paper pulp can be effected at nearly one-half the
cost of bleaching powder. The process is now being industrially
carried out. Those interested in the subject are referred
to a paper by the authors in the ‘Journal of the
Society of Chemical Industry’
for April 1887.</p>

CHAPTER VIII.
<span class="hsmall">
BEATING.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">The bleached pulp is now ready for the final treatment. If
it were attempted to make paper from the pulp in the state
in which it leaves the “potchers” or “steeping” chests, it
would be found to be wanting in evenness of texture and
uniformity of surface. This result can only be secured by
an elaborate process of comminution or disintegration. This
is in effect the result produced by the action of the
“beaters.”</p>

<p>They resemble in general appearance the breaking engines
previously described; the roll, however, carries more knives,
and it is usually let down much nearer to the bed-plate. In
the case of fibrous substances, whose ultimate fibres are relatively
short (see table, p. <a href="#p039" title="go to p. 39">39</a>), it is only necessary to split up
the filaments into their constituent fibres: esparto, straw,
and wood are of this class. In the case of straw, the disintegration
is for the most part ac­com­plished in the boiling
and bleaching processes, and therefore but little work
devolves upon the beater. Esparto and wood require a
certain amount of beating, but this should be regulated to
the drawing asunder of the individual fibres, any cutting of
the fibres being carefully avoided. This is ac­com­plished by
adjusting the distance of the roll from the bed-plate, so that
by the friction of the fibres upon themselves, when passing
over the plate, a kind of rubbing or “brushing” is produced.
If a carefully-made paper of esparto or wood be examined by
the microscope, it will be found that the majority of the
fibres preserve the pointed or
slightly rounded ends <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
characteristic of bast cells. On the other hand, it is obvious
that cotton, whose ultimate fibres have a length of 20 to
40 mm., and flax (25–30 mm.), with other similar fibres, will
require to be broken up into short fragments in order to
develop to the fullest the felting property of the pulp. Not
only are the fibres reduced to the most favourable dimensions,
but in cotton and linen a further contributory advantage
accrues; for on account of the internal structure of the
ultimate fibres they tend to split up at the point of rupture
into a number of fibrillæ, which, in the case of cotton, take
the form of a network; and in case of linen, are seen as a
bundle of distinct fibres parallel to and continuous with the
fibre. This gives to ends of the fragments a ragged contour,
which has considerable influence on the felting power of
the pulp, and therefore on the strength of the paper into
which it is made.</p>

<p>With these fibres, therefore, the “cutting” as distinguished
from the “breaking” action should be avoided as much as
possible, otherwise the effect described above will not be
produced, and the fibres will show instead a clean cut. The
appearance shown by cotton and linen pulp, when thoroughly
“beaten” and ready to be made into paper, is given in
the frontispiece, which is taken from the author’s micro-photographs.</p>

<p>The “half-stuff” is furnished to the “beater,” or “beating”
engine as it is sometimes called, previously partially filled
with water. The furnishing is done in successive portions,
the first being allowed to mix thoroughly with the water before
another lot is added. This is continued until the mass is so
thick that it will only just turn round in the beater under the
action of the “roll.” Owing to the construction of the beater
it frequently happens that a portion of the pulp lodges in
the corners, from which the beaterman removes it by means
of a wooden paddle, which also serves to push forward the
pulp to the roll in case the motion is inclined to be sluggish.
The proportion of water to pulp should not be too high,
otherwise the beating is not so effective; at
the same time, <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
if the mass is allowed to get too thick, imperfect circulation
results.</p>

<p>The operation of “beating” occupies a considerable time,
and consumes a large amount of power. Cotton and linen
rags naturally take longer—in some cases as much as ten
hours is given to the operation.</p>

<p>Esparto, on the other hand, can be sufficiently disintegrated
in from two to four hours.</p>

<p>Wood pulp requires very gentle beating; it is therefore
necessary to prolong the time to about six hours.</p>

<p>These differences in the duration and method of beating
should be borne in mind when pulps of different natures are
mixed together in the same beater, as is frequently the case.
It is better, with very dissimilar fibres, to “beat” each
separately, and only to mix them in the stuff-chests. This,
however, is open to the objection that the pulps may be
insufficiently mixed.</p>

<p>The length of fibre to which pulps should be reduced
depends to some extent upon the kind of paper to which it
is to be applied. The authors have examined a number of
papers by well-known makers, and find the dimensions in
millimetres of various pulps to be as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Wood and straw pulp, when imported in the form of dry
sheets, may, before being beaten, be conveniently disintegrated
and thoroughly mixed with water by means of the
edge-runner described under “Broke Paper,” p. <a href="#p104" title="go to p. 104">104</a>, Fig. 28.</p>

<p>In making the finer kinds of paper, the roller bars or
knives, instead of being made of steel are made of bronze,
thus any contamination with oxide of iron is avoided. This
is especially liable to take place in case of steel knives
when the beater has been allowed to stand for some time.
<span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span></p>

<p>The inside of the heater itself is often lined with lead, a
material which is not liable to oxidize, and which can very
readily be cleaned.</p>

<p>When a beater has been running for some time the knives
of the roll and the bed-plate become worn and so far reduced
that they must be taken out and re-cut. The bed-plate is
removed, firmly fixed in the bed of a planing machine, and
the edges trimmed by means of a chisel, so as to cut the
knives at the proper angle.</p>

<p>The roll and bed-plate are shown in section in Fig. 32.
Fig. 33 is a plan of a bed-plate, and Fig. 34 illustrates the
manner in which the knives are fixed.</p>

<div class="dctr05">

<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
32.</div></div><!--dctr05-->

<p>It will be seen that the knives in the bed-plate are placed
so that they do not lie parallel with those of the roll. This
arrangement imitates to some extent the action of a pair of
scissors. Occasionally the knives are slightly bent, so as to
form a very obtuse angle. Bed-plates so
fitted are called <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span>
“knee-plates.” They are largely used in America, but not
much in this country.</p>

<div class="dctr01">

<p>To obviate the necessity of removing the roll, a small
machine has been devised whereby the knives can be cut <i>in
situ</i>. This machine, which can be firmly fixed between the mid-feather
and the side of the beater, consists of a small steam-engine
which actuates a movable cutter, which is made to
pass to and fro horizontally along the edge of each knife in
succession. The engine is supplied with steam by a piece of
strong flexible rubber tubing.</p>

<p>The ordinary form of beater contains only one roll, though
some have been constructed containing two or even four rolls.
In America, beaters of a totally different construction are
much in vogue. The most important of these are the Jordan
and Kingsland beaters, so called from the names of the
inventors. The former consists essentially of a roll in the
shape of a truncated cone, fitted with knives in the usual
way, revolving in an iron box of corresponding shape,
furnished with knives placed in the direction of its length,
but at slightly different angles. The half-stuff enters the
beater at the narrow end through a box
provided with an <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span>
arrangement for regulating the flow, and is discharged by
two or more openings in the cover at the wider end.</p>

<p>The Kingsland engine consists of a circular chamber,
the sides of which are covered with knives, and between
which a circular plate, also furnished with knives, revolves.
The pulp enters through a pipe in the centre of one of the
sides of the chamber, and flows out through an opening in
the opposite side.</p>

<p>Another form of beater is that invented by S. L. Gould. The
only essential difference between it and the Kingsland beater
is that, instead of having a plate which revolves vertically
against two stationary ones, the plate, which is placed horizontally,
is furnished with knives on one side only, and
revolves upon but one fixed plate, much in the same way as
a pair of millstones.</p>

<p>The half-stuff supplied to these forms of beater is generally
disintegrated to a greater extent in the breaker than is the
case with those of the ordinary construction, as it is necessary
to make it flow easily through them, and this could not be
done if the fibres were kept long. A single passage of the
pulp through the beater is sufficient to beat it up ready for
making into paper. The chief advantages claimed for them
is that they are more economical, both of time and power;
also that the pulp is more regularly beaten.</p>

<p>Certain new forms of beaters have lately been introduced
in this country, and are rapidly gaining in favour, chiefly on
account of the saving of driving power, and the space occupied,
compared with the amount of “stuff” they are capable
of beating. Fig. 35 shows the construction of Forbes’ patent
engine, as manufactured by Messrs. G. &#x26; W. Bertram, of
Edinburgh. This beater is divided into three channels.
The rolls, one of which is shown uncovered, are placed in the
outer channels, while in the centre one the mixing and circulating
wheel a is placed, the peculiar construction of which
enables it to throw the pulp alternately into the two outer
channels, from whence, after passing under the rolls again, it
enters the central channel at the other end
of the beater. <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span></p>

<p>In Umpherston’s patent engine great economy of space
is effected by causing the pulp to travel over and under the
backfall (<i>a</i>, Fig. 36). Another advantage is that the stuff
circulates freely with less water than in the ordinary forms,
thus increasing its output. It is also claimed that the pulp
is beaten with less power, and as it is less liable to lodge
in corners it is more evenly beaten.</p>

<div class="dctr01">

<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>

<p>The construction of the engine will be readily understood
by reference to Fig. 36. The direction which the stuff takes
is indicated by the arrows.</p>

<p>Cooke and Hibbert’s beater, as manufactured by Messrs.
Masson, Scott and Bertram, resembles, to a certain extent,
Gould’s engine, previously described; it differs from it, however,
in that the discs are placed vertically, instead of horizontally.
Moreover, the general construction of the beater
more nearly resembles those in ordinary use. Fig. 37, which
shows it in plan and in section at the line D E, illustrates
its construction.</p></div><!--section-->

a great saving in time and power is effected, and that moreover

<p>The quality of the water used to furnish the engine is a
matter of very great importance, especially in the manufacture
of high-class papers. Above all it should be free
from suspended matter, and from dissolved iron; the former
finds its way directly into the paper, and the latter is liable
to become precipitated in the pulp as oxide, thus injuriously
affecting its colour. Careful settling and filtration are sufficient
to eliminate insoluble matter; soluble impurities are
more difficult of removal; therefore the water should, if
possible, be free from them. In most mills settling ponds
are provided, for the purpose of removing suspended matter,
and in addition it is usual to
employ woollen filter-bags <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
fastened to the nozzle of the pipe that supplies the beaters
with water.</p>

<p>For methods of purifying water see p. <a href="#p211" title="go to p. 211">211</a>.</p>

<p>The beaters are generally driven from a separate engine,
and are connected with it by a system of spur-wheels,
pinions, and belts. Messrs. G. and W. Bertram have lately
introduced a system of direct driving of beaters, whereby a
great saving in power is effected. It is illustrated in plan
and elevation in Figs. 38 and 39. The crank-shaft of the
engine is coupled direct on to the main driving-shaft. Large
pulleys are keyed on to this shaft, from which the power is
taken directly on to the pulleys connected
with the rolls.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The bleached half-stuff as it leaves the steeping chests
usually contains an excess of bleaching liquor, which can be
removed in two ways, viz. by washing or by decomposition
with an “antichlor.” The first method has the advantage of
not only removing the bleach, but of also eliminating the
chloride of calcium, partly existing ready formed, and also
that resulting from the decomposition of the calcium hypochlorite
originally present in the bleach. On the other hand,
this method takes some time, and consumes a large amount
of water, which in some mills is a matter of considerable
importance. For this purpose, many beaters are provided
with one or more drum washers (see Fig. 36). An additional
objection to this method lies in the fact that a certain
quantity of fibre passes through the meshes of the wire-cloth
covering the washers, and is thus lost.</p>

<p>The more usual plan is to remove the bleach by decomposing
it with an “antichlor.” The substance generally
employed for this purpose is sodium hyposulphite, or thiosulphate
as it is now called, which, in presence of calcium
hypochlorite, is oxidized to sodium sulphate, the latter being
reduced to calcium chloride. Double decomposition then
takes place between these salts, with the formation of
calcium sulphate and sodium chloride. The reactions which
take place may be expressed by the following <span class="nowrap">equation:—</span></p>

<p>At the particular degree of dilution which occurs in a
beater, the bleach is decomposed almost entirely according to
the first of the equations; from which, on calculating, it will
be seen that 158 parts of sodium thiosulphate are equivalent
to 286 parts of calcium hypochlorite. As commercial sodium
thiosulphate contains 36·3 per cent. of water, and bleaching
powder 70 per cent. of calcium hypochlorite, on the basis of
35 per cent. available chlorine it follows that 248 parts of
the former are required to neutralize 409 parts of the latter.</p>

<p>Within the last few years other forms of “antichlor”
have been introduced, such, for example, as the various
sulphites. The most important of these is sodium sulphite,
which has been manufactured by a patent process at a
cheap rate, by Gaskell, Deacon, &#x26; Co., Widnes. Their product
contained as much as 75 per cent. of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, ordinary
crystallized sodium sulphite containing only 50 per cent.</p>

<p>Sulphites are converted by the action of bleach into
sulphates, <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

</div><!--dequationbox-->

<p>From this equation, it will be seen that 252 parts
of sodium sulphite will neutralize 143 parts of calcium
hypochlorite, or 204·3 parts of bleaching powder.
Assuming that crystallized sodium sulphite contains
50 per cent. Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, the same
amount of bleach would require 504 parts. As Messrs.
Gaskell, Deacon &#x26; Co.’s sulphite contains 75 per
cent. Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, only 336 parts are
needed. Comparing these numbers with <span class="xxpn"
id="p129">{129}</span> those given above for sodium
hyposulphite, it will be seen that 204·5 parts of bleach
require for neutralisation 129 parts of sodium thiosulphate
and 504 parts of crystallised sodium sulphite, or 336 parts
of the stronger product.</p>

<p>Sodium sulphite is preferred to sodium thiosulphate by
some paper makers, notwithstanding the fact that even in
its most concentrated form, nearly three times as much is
required to produce a certain result. It is said that when it
is used the wire cloth of the machine is preserved for a
longer time than if sodium thiosulphate is employed. This
may be due to the fact that with the latter a certain amount
of free acid is always formed, which of course would act
injuriously on the wire; whereas, when sodium sulphite is
used, the products of decomposition are neutral salts without
any action upon metals. (See the above equations.)</p>

<p>A very cheap “antichlor” may be prepared by boiling
together lime and sulphur. One hundred and sixty-eight
parts of lime, made into a milk with water, are heated to
boiling in an iron vessel. Three hundred and eighty-four
parts of flour of sulphur or ground sulphur are then added
in small quantities at a time, and the boiling continued until
the whole is dissolved. The liquid which is now of a deep
yellow colour, is allowed to settle and cool and is then ready
for use. It contains a mixture of calcium thiosulphate and
calcium pentasulphide, the latter compound giving to it its
deep yellow colour. The following equation represents the
action which takes place between the lime and the <span class="nowrap">sulphur:—</span></p>

<p>From this it is seen that a large quantity of free sulphur
is formed, which is precipitated as a fine yellowish powder
in the fibre. This not only affects the colour of the pulp,
but is objectionable on account of its liability, in contact
with the hot cylinders of the paper machine, or by the
action of moisture over a long period of time to become
oxidised to sulphuric acid, which undoubtedly, even if
present only in very small quantities, has an injurious
effect upon the finished paper. (See hydracellulose.)
This property of sulphur and its action upon cellulose may
be shown by the following experiment. Take a piece of
water-leaf paper, rub into it a mixture of flour of sulphur
and water. If the paper thus treated be rapidly dried, it
will be found to be weakened or even slightly charred in
those portions which have been in contact with the sulphur.
(See also Chem. Soc. Journ., p. 249, 1879.)</p>

<p>Whichever variety of “antichlor” is used an excess should
be carefully avoided, as all act more or less upon the size
and colouring matter added to the pulp subsequently. The
proper method is to run in small quantities of a solution of
the antichlor at a time, testing the pulps, after allowing a
few minutes for complete admixture after each addition.
The test is made by immersing a piece of iodide of potassium
and starch paper, which will be turned blue so long as any
calcium hypochlorite is present. These papers are made as
<span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Three grms. of starch are ground up with a small quantity
of water and poured into 700 cc. of boiling water, and to
the solution 1 grm. of iodide of potassium and 0·5 grm.
carbonate of soda are added. Sheets of white paper, water-leaf
in preference, are now soaked in the solution and dried.
In presence of calcium hypochlorite, iodine is liberated from
the potassium iodide, and acting upon the starch forms with
it a characteristic blue colour.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Loading.</h3>—It
is usual, except in the case of papers of the
very highest quality, to add to the pulp a quantity of some
cheap loading material, such as china clay, or
for the better <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span>
qualities of paper, “pearl-hardening,” or sulphate of lime.
The addition of clay in moderate quantity can hardly be
looked upon as an adulteration, since it serves to fill up the
pores of the paper, and enables it to take a good surface in
the subsequent operations of calendering. Moreover, it
enables the manufacturer to meet the demand for cheap
papers with some chance of remuneration to himself. If
added largely, it of course tends to weaken the paper.</div>

<p>China clay or kaolin is sold in the form of large lumps of a
white or yellowish-white colour. It is formed by the gradual
disintegration of felspar by means of the action of air and
water, and consists essentially of a silicate of aluminium.
Its quality depends upon its whiteness and its freedom from
coarse micaceous particles. It is usually prepared for
admixture with the pulp by making it into a fine cream with
water in a vessel provided with stirrers; it is then passed
through a fine sieve in order to remove any impurities it
may contain, and is then run into the beater. The clay or
other filling material is usually run into the beater as soon
as the latter is charged with pulp, so that by the time the
beating operation is concluded, a perfect admixture of pulp
and clay is effected.</p>

<p>Sulphate of lime, or “pearl-hardening,” is usually sufficiently
pure to put direct into the engine. It is made by
decomposing a solution of calcium chloride, with sulphate of
soda, and is precipitated as a fine brilliantly white powder,
consisting of CaSO<sub>4</sub> + 2&#x200a;H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Two distinct forms of precipitated calcium sulphate are
met with in commerce, differing from each other by their
microscopical features, the one consisting of flat tabular
crystals (Fig. 41), the other of fine needles (Fig. 42).
Another form, erroneously called precipitated pearl-hardening,
is also sold: it consists of the finely ground native
mineral.</p>

<p>Some of the finer qualities of paper are made without
addition of any loading material whatever, though such
papers are of course the exception. The proportion of
clay or <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span> other
material that can be put into a fibre depends to a certain
extent upon the nature of the fibre, and upon the degree of
fineness to which it is reduced in the beater. The amount
added by different makers varies considerably, from <span
class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span> two or three per cent.
to twenty, and even in rare cases to thirty per cent.</p>

<p>A new loading material called “agalite” has been lately
introduced, possessing certain advantages
over china clay, <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span>
or calcium sulphate. Agalite is a mineral of the nature and
chemical properties of asbestos: it consists of nearly pure
magnesium silicate. Its structure is more or less fibrous, like
that of asbestos, which, as is well known, can be spun and
woven and even made into paper, and it therefore, when
added to a paper, forms a part of the fabric itself. It is
even claimed that it assists in keeping back some of the finer
fibres that invariably find their way through the meshes of
the wire cloth, and it is said that 90 per cent. of the amount
added to the engine is found in the paper. In the case of
china clay it is well known that only from 40 to 60 per cent.
is actually “carried” by the pulp. Figs. 40, 41, 42, and 43
show the appearance of china clay, pearl-hardening, and
agalite when viewed under the microscope, magnified 200
times. The nature of agalite is such that it assists the paper
in taking a high finish. This is probably due to its “soapy”
nature, a feature which is characteristic of asbestos, French
chalk, “soap-stone,” and other magnesium silicates.</p>

<p>When papers contain such excessive quantities as 15 or 20 per
cent. of clay, it cannot be to the advantage of the consumer,
and should be looked upon as an adulteration. It is a matter of
some importance to be able to determine rapidly and accurately
the amount of mineral matter in a paper. The usual method is to
ignite a weighed quantity of the paper in a platinum crucible
until the ash so obtained is either white or a very pale grey.
From the weight of the ash, the percentage of mineral matter is
easily calculated. The following is a very convenient plan in
cases where a platinum crucible or dish is not obtainable:—Take
a weighed piece of the paper to be examined, from 2 to 4 in.
square, according to the thickness, roll it into a narrow hollow
cylinder. Round this wind a weighed piece of platinum wire about
<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>50</sub> in. thick, as
in Fig. 44. Hold this by means of a pair of crucible tongs in
the flame of a Bunsen burner until it is completely burned. If
the wire is carefully wound round, and especially if the roll of
paper is made conical, the ash will be securely held in <span
class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span> position. Those who do not
possess a chemical balance of the ordinary form will find a
convenient substitute, which will answer the purpose of weighing
the paper and ash with sufficient accuracy, in the spiral
balance invented by Prof. Jolly<a class="afnanc" href="#fn11"
id="fnanc11">11</a> illustrated in Fig. 44. It consists of a
spiral of hard wire A, which is suspended in front of a mirror
B, upon which millimetre divisions are marked. A small float
D, dipping under the surface of the water in the vessel E, is
provided for the purpose of steadying the spiral and allowing it
to come quickly to rest. The balance is provided with a light
pan made of a thin plate of mica, and suspended by very thin
platinum wires. For the present purpose, however, the pan is
not necessary, and it can be replaced by the roll of paper and
platinum coil as shown in the drawing.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc11" id="fn11">11</a>
This balance can be obtained
from Nalder Bros. &#x26; Co., Westminster.</p></div>

<p>The method of using is exceedingly simple,
as the increase in the length of the spiral is in
direct ratio to the increment of weight. The
position of the spiral is ascertained by placing
the eye in a direct line with the small glass
bead C and its image in the mirror, and noting
the corresponding division on the scale. The
position of the bead can be altered so as to
bring it to any desired point on the scale by
raising or lowering the upright rod F, which
is kept in position by the screw G. The
balance stands on a foot provided with levelling screws.</p>

<p>It is evident that where <i>proportional</i> weights only are
required it is not necessary to know the value of the spiral,
but if the balance is to be used to ascertain <i>actual</i> weights,
the coefficient of the spiral must first be determined. This
is done by noting the increase in length after the addition
of a one gram weight. The spirals are made of different
thicknesses of wire, which of course
give varying degrees <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
of sensibility: the most useful is one which gives with one
gram an extension of 100 millimetres: one mm. being therefore
equivalent to one mgrm.</p>

<p>The following experiment will illustrate the method
of using the balance and of calculating the results of a
determination of the amount of mineral matter in a <span

<p>In order to ascertain the percentage of mineral matter

amount of ash obtained a certain quantity due to the mineral
matter in the fibre of which the paper is composed. This

method by which it has been prepared. The following

<p>If the paper contains calcium sulphate the ash obtained
may consist partly of calcium sulphide, due to the reducing
action of the carbon found on ignition, and
the amount will <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span>
therefore not represent the true amount added. The ash
should be moistened with a few drops of sulphuric acid, and
again ignited, in order to reconvert it into calcium sulphate.
It should also be borne in mind that the sulphate of lime as
present in the paper is combined with two atoms of water
CaSO<sub>4</sub> + 2&#x200a;H<sub>2</sub>O, and therefore that every part of calcium
sulphate obtained represents 1·26 parts of “pearl-hardening”
actually added.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Sizing.</h3>—Papers
that are intended to be written upon with
ink, and also most printing papers, require to have the
interstices of the fibres filled up with some material which
will to a greater or less extent resist the action of water, and
thus prevent the ink or other liquid applied to them from
“running.” This may be ac­com­plished in two ways, viz.,
by “engine-sizing” and “tub-sizing”; the former is so
called because it is performed in the beating engine itself,
the latter being done on the finished paper, as will be subsequently
described. Engine-sizing consists in precipitating
a compound called resinate of alumina in the pulp. This
compound when dried has the property of being with difficulty
wetted with water. In order to obtain a thorough
mixture of this compound with the fibre it is formed in the
engine by adding an aqueous solution of rosin-soap to the
pulp, and when this is intimately mixed with it, running in
a solution of alum.</div>

<p>Rosin (colophony) consists of a mixture of pinic and sylvic
acids, which, when heated with a solution of carbonate of
soda, combine with the alkali to form a soap, carbonic acid
being evolved. The soap is prepared in the following
<span class="nowrap">manner:—</span></p>

<p>Ordinary rosin, the quality depending upon the
quality of paper, is boiled in a jacketed pan for from
two to three hours with a solution of carbonate of
soda, until a sample of the soap formed is completely
soluble in water. The quantity of carbonate of soda
<span class="nowrap">
(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>&#x202f;10&#x200a;H<sub>2</sub>O)</span>
required is about 30 per cent. of the weight of the
rosin. It is usual to employ crystallised carbonate
of soda (soda-crystals), but <span class="xxpn"
id="p138">{138}</span> soda-ash of good quality, or even
caustic soda, might very well be employed, in which case of
course the proportion would be different.</p>

<p>A very convenient form of carbonate of soda has
lately been introduced by Messrs. Gaskell, Deacon &#x26;
Co., which goes by the name of “Crystal Carbonate.”
It is obtained in the form of minute crystals of
the mono-hydrate, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> +
H<sub>2</sub>O. It contains 50 per cent. of alkali
<span class="nowrap">(Na<sub>2</sub>O),</span> and possesses this advantage over
soda-ash, that is dissolves readily in water without
forming a hard cake. It is much cheaper in proportion
than soda crystals, as the expense of crystallisation and
carriage is saved. The latter contain only 21·68 per cent.
Na<sub>2</sub>O, 62·93 per cent. of their weight consisting
of water of crystallisation. One hundred parts of soda
crystals are equivalent to 43·36 parts of the “Crystal
Carbonate.”</p>

<p>An excess of soda should be carefully avoided, as it consumes
an equivalent quantity of alum (see below): on the
other hand, it is very essential that the rosin should be completely
dissolved, otherwise small particles are sure to find
their way into the pulp, and would form clear transparent
specks in the finished paper.</p>

<p>The boiling being completed, the charge is run off into iron
tanks and allowed to settle; the soap forms a semi-solid
mass, while a dark-coloured liquor, containing the impurities
of the rosin, rises to the surface, and can thus be removed.
The soap so purified is next dissolved in hot water containing
a small quantity of carbonate of soda, in case complete
solubility has not been attained, and is then mixed with a
quantity of starch paste prepared in a separate vessel by
dissolving starch in boiling water. The mixture is then
carefully sieved and is ready for use.</p>

<p>The proportion of starch to rosin differs in nearly every
mill, and also the quantity of size to be added to the beater
varies according as the paper is required to be soft or hard-sized.
About 3 parts of starch to 1 of rosin, and between 3
or 4 lbs. of the mixture to 100 lbs. of pulp may be considered
an average quantity. Some manufacturers prefer
to add the <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
starch and rosin size to the engine separately; others again
do not dissolve the starch in water, but merely make it up to
a thin paste, in which state it is added to the pulp. This
method is employed by makers of very fine papers, as it is
said to give a certain feel to the paper which cannot be
obtained in any other way. The method is costly, as only
a small proportion of the starch added is actually found in
the paper.</p>

<p>Some papers, which are not intended to be sized, such as
blotting and filter-papers, are made with the addition of
starch only, this being used to bind the fibres together to
some extent. The presence of the starch does not prevent
the paper from being absorbent. Papers which are intended
to be tub-sized only are usually made up with a small
quantity of starch, and are sometimes sized to a small extent
with rosin also. The addition of a certain amount of ordinary
soap to the rosin soap is said to give good results; it
enables the paper to take a higher finish when calendered.
Sizing with animal size (gelatine), or Tub-sizing as it is
called, will be described in Chapter X.</p>

<p>The mixture of size and starch may be added directly to the
engine, or it may be previously dissolved in water; the latter
method is perhaps preferable. After allowing it to mix
thoroughly with the pulp, a solution of alum is run in. It
is made up with boiling water in either lead or copper tanks.
Iron or zinc vessels must be avoided, as the solution acts
rapidly on these metals.</p>

<p>Alum consists of a double sulphate of aluminium
and potassium or ammonium, <span class="nowrap">
Al<sub>2</sub>&#x2006;3&#x200a;SO<sub>4</sub>,&#x200a;K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span>
+ <span class="nowrap">24&#x200a;H<sub>2</sub>O;</span> its
function being to form with the rosin acids insoluble soaps
which are precipitated in intimate mixture with the pulp,
the sulphate of potash taking no part in the reaction.
The choice of a suitable alum is a matter of very great
importance; it should be free from excess of sulphuric acid
and from iron. The former is deleterious on account of its
action upon the colouring matter used to tone the paper,
some colours being completely discharged by it; and because
<span class="xxpn" id="p140">{140}</span> of its effect
upon any metal work with which it may come in contact,
especially upon the brass wire-cloth on which the paper
is made. The iron is objectionable as it forms a dark red
precipitate of oxide of iron.</p>

<p>Alum as supplied by makers of repute is generally sufficiently
pure for even the best classes of paper.</p>

<p>Many years ago a substitute for alum was introduced,
called Pochin’s aluminous cake. It consisted principally
of sulphate of alumina <span class="nowrap">
Al<sub>2</sub>&#x2006;3&#x200a;SO<sub>4</sub>,</span> and
was, provided it was pure, as suitable for the papermaker
as the more expensive potash alum. It was more economical
at equal price, as it contained about 14 per cent. of
alumina, whereas potash alum, even if absolutely pure,
could only contain 10·85 per cent. Pochin’s aluminous cake
however, was liable to contain a considerable amount of
free sulphuric acid and soluble sulphate of iron. Of late
years, a number of different varieties of sulphates of
alumina have been introduced into commerce, of so pure a
nature, and at such a low price, that it is a matter of
wonder that they have not entirely superseded the more
expensive alum. They are prepared either from very pure
native alumina (bauxite), or from China clay of good
quality. Methods have been discovered of eliminating
almost the whole of the iron and free sulphuric acid. The
following analyses of different specimens sufficiently
indicate their purity.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn12"

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc12" id="fn12">12</a>
Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind., Jan. 1886, p. 16.</p></div>

<p>Sulphate of alumina possesses this advantage over alum,
that it is more soluble in water, and thus a stock solution of
considerable strength can be prepared. It
is soluble in <span class="xxpn" id="p141">{141}</span>
2 parts of cold water, alum requiring 18 parts for complete
solution.</p>

<p>The amount of alum or sulphate of alumina added to a
pulp is largely in excess of the quantity necessary to precipitate
the rosin soap; as a matter of fact, in the case of
esparto or straw pulps, for the bleaching of which considerable
quantities of bleach have been employed, and which therefore
contain a certain amount of basic lime, together with
calcium chloride, complete precipitation of the size is
effected without the addition of alum. A certain amount is
also required to precipitate the starch. The excess of alum
appears to be necessary, however, not only to brighten the
colour of the paper, but also to render it capable of resisting
the action of ink. From experiments made by the authors,
it appears that one part of rosin requires 2·9 parts of alum
for complete precipitation from its solution in soda. One part
of starch requires 0·40 part alum.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Colouring.</h3>—Cellulose,
except in rare instances, is never
sufficiently white to produce a perfectly white paper, and
the manufacturer finds it necessary to complement the
slightly yellow colour which most bleached pulps possess by
the addition of small quantities of blue and pink colouring
materials. The blues usually employed are ultramarine,
smalts, and aniline blues; the pinks are generally preparations
of either cochineal or aniline dyes. Ultramarine is
met with in commerce as a bright blue powder; the shade
of colour and the quality of which vary considerably.</div>

<p>In choosing an ultramarine, attention should be directed
not only to its tinctorial power but to its behaviour with a
solution of alum, inferior qualities being entirely discharged
by it. All ultramarines are readily decomposed by free
acids, hence the necessity of employing an alum as free as
possible from this impurity.</p>

<p>Smalts on the other hand resists the action of acids, but it
is only used for the finer qualities of paper, owing to its
high price. The aniline blues are perhaps scarcely so
brilliant in colour as the above-mentioned
colours, and they <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
are moreover somewhat readily discharged by the action of
light; they have however the advantage of cheapness.</p>

<p>The pink colouring matters are sold either as lakes, that
is, compounds of the colouring matter with alumina or as
solutions. They are also frequently to be met with mixed
with starch in varying proportions. Those made from
cochineal are superior to those containing aniline colours.</p>

<p>Ultramarine can be detected by means of its reaction with
hydrochloric acid, the colour being discharged and sulphuretted
hydrogen evolved, which can be recognised by its
odour. Smalts is not acted upon by acids. The latter contains
cobalt, the presence of which can be determined by its
giving a blue bead with borax in a blowpipe flame.</p>

<p>The aniline blues are soluble either in hot water or hot
alcohol, the liquid being intensely coloured. Most of them
are discharged by treatment either with strong acids or
alkalis, the colour being restored by the reverse treatment.</p>

<p>Paper of any desired colour may be made either by using
rags already dyed the necessary colour or by adding to the
bleached pulp in the beater such dyes or pigments as will
produce it. Any colouring matter which can be obtained in
the form of a fine powder or as a solution can be used. Blue
papers are usually coloured with ultramarine; the dark blue
papers used for wrapping sugar and other purposes are
coloured with Prussian blue, either added directly to the
beater or produced in it by the action of potassium ferrocyanide
on ferric sulphate.</p>

<p>The so-called toned paper is produced by adding to the
pulp a solution of pernitrate of iron, from which a fine
precipitate of oxide of iron is deposited on the fibres;
thus the slightly brown shade characteristic of this kind
of paper is produced. The same effect may be produced by
the addition of yellow ochre or some similar pigment.
The following are a few of the materials which are used
for producing coloured papers:—Methyl violet, eosine,
chrome yellow, venetian red, catechu. Useful receipts
for the preparation of coloured papers will be found in
Dunbar’s ‘Practical Paper-Maker.’ <span class="xxpn"
id="p143">{143}</span></p>

<p>During the time that the loading, sizing and colouring
processes have been going on, the pulp has been continually
acted upon by the roll, and if these operations have extended
over a considerable time, it is probably in a proper condition
for making into paper. The amount of “beating” depends,
as has been stated before, upon the nature of the fibre, and
also to some extent on the nature of the paper for which it is
intended. The “beaterman” examines the pulp from time
to time by taking a portion from the engine and placing it in
a hand-bowl containing water: from its appearance when so
diluted he is able to judge of the time during which it may
be necessary to continue the disintegration. As soon as this
is completed, the pulp is ready to be let down to the stuff-chests,
usually placed at a lower level than the beaters, so
that the pulp can flow into them by gravity. For this
purpose the valve at the bottom of the engine is opened:
to remove the last portion of pulp it is necessary to rinse out
the engine with water.</p>

<h2 class="h2herein" title="Chapter X.">
CHAPTER X.
<span class="hsmall">
PAPER MACHINES; HAND-MADE PAPER.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">The pulp as it comes from the beaters is
now ready to be made into paper. We will first consider
briefly the manufacture of hand-made paper.</p>

<p>It is made on a mould of wire-cloth, with a movable
frame of wood, called the “deckle,” fitting on to the outside
of the mould and extending slightly above its surface.</p>

<p>The wire-cloth is generally supported by a much coarser
wire-cloth, or by pieces of thick wire, and these again by
wedge-shaped pieces of wood, the thin end being next to
the wire.</p>

<p>To form a sheet of paper the workman dips the mould,
with the “deckle” in position, into a vat containing the prepared
pulp diluted with water, lifting up just so much as will
make a sheet of the necessary thickness. As soon as the
mould is removed from the vat, the water begins to drain
through the wire-cloth, and to leave the fibres on the surface
in the form of a coherent sheet of paper. The felting or intertwining
is assisted by lateral motion in every direction given
to the frame by the workman. The movable deckle is then
removed, and the mould, with the sheet of paper, given to
another workman, called the “coucher,” who turns it over
and presses it against the felt, by this means transferring
the sheet from the wire to the felt. In the meantime the
“vat-man” is engaged in the formation of another sheet
with a second mould.</p>

<div class="dfloatright dwth-h">
<img src="images/i144fp.jpg" width="227" height="1280" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption">The Fourdrinier Paper Machine.
Plate I.</div></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>A number of the sheets thus formed are piled together,
alternately with pieces of felt, and when a
sufficient number <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span>
have been obtained, the whole is subjected to strong pressure,
to expel the water. The felts are then removed, and the
sheets again pressed.</p>

<p>They are then sized, if required, by dipping them into a
solution of gelatine: again slightly pressed, and hung up on
lines or poles to dry. Such paper is called loft-dried.</p>

<p>When dry the sheets of paper are calendered. (See
Chapter XI.)</p>

<p>The making of paper by hand involves considerable dexterity
on the part of the workman; on account of the expensive
labour necessary, in comparison with paper-machines,
it is comparatively little practised in the present day; certain
kinds of paper, however, such as bank-notes, various
drawing papers, and printing papers intended for the production
of very elaborate editions are always made in this
way.</p>

<p>Any pattern or name required on the paper is obtained by
means of a raised pattern on the wire-cloth mould: consequently,
less pulp lodges there, and the paper is proportionally
thinner, thus showing the exact counterpart of the
pattern. Such devices are known as “water-marks.” (See
also p. <a href="#p156" title="go to p. 156">156</a>.)</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">The Paper Machine.</h3>—The
paper machine of the present
day, with all its ingenious improvements, differs but little
in principle from that originally constructed by Fourdrinier.
It consists essentially of an endless mould of wire-cloth,
on to which the prepared pulp flows, and on which a
continuous sheet of paper is formed. The sheet of paper
then passes through a series of rollers and over a number of
heated cylinders, where it is completely dried.</div>

<p>A modern Fourdrinier paper machine is shown in plan
and side elevation in Plates I. and II.</p>

<p>The pulp, after leaving the beaters, passes into a large
vessel called the stuff-chest, of which there are one or more
to each machine. As soon as the beater is empty, water is
run in to thoroughly rinse out the remaining pulp, the
washings also going into the stuff-chests.
These may be <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span>
made either of wood or iron, and should be provided with
arms fixed on a vertical shaft, made to revolve by suitable
gearing. The arms are for the purpose of keeping the pulp
thoroughly mixed, and should only work at a moderate
speed, otherwise they are liable to cause the fibres to form
into small knots or lumps. The pulp is drawn from the
stuff-chests by means of the pump A, and is discharged into
a regulating-box (not shown). The object of this box is
to keep a regular and constant supply of pulp on the
machine. It consists of a cylindrical vessel, having two
overflow-pipes near the top, and a discharge-pipe near the
bottom. The pulp is pumped in through a ball-valve in the
bottom, in larger quantity than is actually needed, the excess
flowing away back into the stuff-chests, through the two
overflow-pipes. By this means, the box is always kept full,
and therefore the stream of pulp issuing out of the bottom
pipe is always under the same pressure. It flows from this
pipe, the quantity being regulated by means of a cock, according
to the thickness of paper required, directly on to
the sand-tables. These may be of various sizes and shapes,
but should be so large that the pulp takes some little time to
travel over them. They consist of long shallow troughs,
generally of a sinuous form. The bottoms are sometimes
covered with woollen felt, or with thin strips of wood placed
across the direction of the flow of the pulp, and at a slight
angle. These serve to retain any particles, such as sand and
dirt, that may have escaped removal in the previous treatment
of the pulp, and that are heavy enough to have sunk down
during the passage of the pulp along the sand-tables. In
some mills, where great care is exercised, the pulp is caused
to flow over sand-tables 200 yards in length. As the pulp,
when it leaves the stuff-chests, does not contain sufficient
water for the purpose of making paper, it is mixed, where it
enters the sand-tables, with a quantity of water from the
“save-all” (see p. <a href="#p154" title="go to p. 154">154</a>), flowing from the box B placed at a
higher level.</p>

<p>In some mills, instead of being
pumped into the <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span>
regulating-box, the pulp flows into a small vessel below the stuff-chest,
and is lifted on to the sand-tables by means of buckets
fastened on the circumference of a wheel.</p>

<p>The pulp, after leaving the sand-tables, passes on to the
strainers. These consist of strong brass or bronze plates,
having a large number of very fine <span class="nowrap">
<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u1d5b5-v.png" width="48" height="80"
alt="V" />-shaped</span>
slits cut in them, the narrowest end being on the outside.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Strainers.</h3>—The
strainers are for the purpose of removing from the pulp all
lumps formed by the intertwining of the fibres, and all
pieces of unboiled fibre, which, if allowed to pass on, would
show in the paper as inequalities in the surface, or as dark
specks. The slits are made narrow at the top, and gradually
increasing in width, so as to prevent them from getting choked
up. These slits allow only the individual fibres to pass
through, and their width varies according to the quality of
the paper. They are from 2 to 3 in. long, and they vary in
width from ·007 to ·05 in. They are put at distances of about
<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub> in. apart. Several
plates, each containing about 500 slits, are bolted together,
and form a strainer. The whole strainer receives a violent
shaking motion, to assist the passage of the fibres through the
slits. In the machine represented, two of these strainers are
shown at C. The shaking motion is produced by the ratchet-wheel
or cams <i>a</i> acting on the hammer <i>b</i>. An improved form, called
the “revolving strainer,” has of late years been introduced.
The pulp generally passes first through one of these, and then
through the ordinary or “flat” strainers, as they are called. A
revolving strainer is shown at D. It consists of a rectangular
box, the sides of which are formed of plates perforated with
slits. Inside this box, a slight vacuum is formed by means of
an indiarubber bellows worked by a crank on the shaft <i>d</i>.
The vacuum is intended to serve the purpose of the shake
in the ordinary form. The box revolves slowly inside a vat
containing the pulp, and the strained pulp flows into the box
D<sup>1</sup>, and thence on to the flat strainers.</div>

<p>Various patents have been taken out from time
to time for <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span>
flat strainers worked by means of a vacuum underneath the
plates caused by the motion of discs of indiarubber or thin
metal. Fig. 45 shows in plan a set of strainers, as manufactured
by Messrs. G. &#x26; W. Bertram, similar to those in
Plate II., but illustrated somewhat more in detail.</p>

<p>The pulp first passes through the flat strainer B, and from
thence to the two revolving strainers A. From these it
flows along the shoots placed at the side on to the paper-machine
at E.</p>

<p>Fig. 46 gives a view of a patent flat vacuum strainer
made by the same firm, which may also be used for cleaning
straw or esparto previous to its passage over a <i>presse-pâte</i>.
The pulp flows on to the strainer at <i>a</i>, and
passes away by <span class="xxpn" id="p149">{149}</span>
the cast-iron pipes <i>f</i>. The valve <i>g</i> is for running off waste
pulp. The plates are placed at a slope of about 1 in. in their
length; those nearest the supply of pulp are provided with
coarser slits, as the impetus carries the knots forward. The
vacuum pumps are worked by the rods <i>d</i> from the shaft <i>e</i>.
By means of the tubes <i>c</i> water can be directed on to the
plates, whereby the coarser particles of fibre are carried
forward, and the slits are kept clean. The plates can be
removed in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Figs. 47 and 48 show in side and end elevation, Messrs.
Masson, Scott, &#x26; Bertram’s patent self-cleaning strainer. The
novelty consists in an arrangement by means of which the
upper surface of the plates are continually freed from those
portions of the pulp which cannot pass through the slits.</p>

<p>The scrapers <i>d</i> are made of vulcanised indiarubber, and
are continually carried forward by an endless chain; the
knots, &#x26;c., collect in a heap at the end of
a strainer. The <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span>
pulp flows on at <i>a</i>, and passes away through the pipe <i>b</i>.

<div class="section">
<p>Messrs. C. H. &#x26; F. L. Roeckner’s patent strainer (No. 7932,
1885) consists of a series of cylindrical tubes, open at one end
and perforated with slits. They are placed in a vat into
which the pulp flows. Inside the cylinders are placed two,
three, or more plates, fixed to the shafts on which the cylinders
are supported, and extending to the circumference. These
plates form a kind of fan, which, together with the cylinders,
are caused to oscillate by means of a rod and cranks. This
oscillating motion serves to draw the fibres through the slits,
and at the same time to keep the outsides of the cylinders
clean. The cylinders are easily removable.</p>

<p>After a time, the slits in the plates get too large, owing to
the plate having been worn away by the constant friction of
the fibres, and as they are very expensive, various attempts
have been made to invent plans for partially closing them
again. Hammering will effect this, but is liable to break
the plates. Annandale of Beltonford has introduced a
method of closing the plates, by means of heavy pressure
acting on small steel rollers moving on each side of the slit,
in which is placed a small sheet of metal the exact thickness
of the width desired. <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span></p>

<p>Another method of closing the plates consists in filling
them up by means of electrically deposited copper or other
metal. They can then be recut in the usual way.</p>

<p>In the case of revolving strainers, all that cannot pass
through the slits falls to the bottom of the vat, in connection
with which it is customary to have an auxiliary strainer,
or “patent knotter,” as it is called, shown at E. All fibre
that passes through this one, which is of the ordinary flat
kind with shaking motion, goes into a box near E′, called
the “low box” for “save-all” water (see p. <a href="#p154" title="go to p. 154">154</a>).</p>

<p>The pulp, after passing through the strainers, should be
perfectly free from knots and impurities, and in a fit condition
for making paper. In the machine shown, it passes from
the last strainer directly on to the wire, its flow being
regulated by a movable gate <i>e</i>. In some cases, however, it
first flows into a small vat, in the centre of which revolves
a rod carrying paddles, with the object of keeping the pulp
well stirred up. It is carried right on to the wire by means
of the apron, a piece of canvas, oil-cloth, or sheet rubber, one
end of which is fastened to the breast-board <i>e′</i>, the other
end resting on, and covering the wire to the extent of
about 15 in. The edges of the apron are rolled up to prevent
the pulp from overflowing. After leaving the apron, it passes
under a gate, or “slicer,” as it is sometimes called, made
of two pieces of brass, overlapping each other in the centre,
and bolted together. It is made thus to enable it to be
lengthened or shortened according to the width of the paper;
its height from the wire-cloth can be altered by means of
screws, and should be equal at all points, in order to ensure
a uniformly thick sheet of paper. The ends of the two
pieces forming the slicer are fastened to the frame <i>f</i> or
“deckle,” as it is called, and this again is carried by two or
more rods stretching right across the wire, and fastened by
small upright supports on both sides to the frame <i>g</i>. The
deckle-frame also carries the grooved pulleys <i>h</i>, along which
the deckle-straps <i>i</i>, endless square bands of indiarubber,
move. <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span></p>

<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>

<p>The object of the deckle-straps is to regulate the width
of the paper; they form, together with the wire-cloth, a
kind of mould into which the pulp flows, thus corresponding
to the mould used in hand-made paper-making. The width of
the paper can be altered by shifting the position of the
frame <i>f</i>, and also the deckle-straps, which are carried
on it as described, the pulleys <i>h</i> being so arranged that
they slide along the rods on which they revolve. In order
to alter the width of the paper it is necessary to stop
the flow of pulp on to the wire, and it not only con­sumes
a con­si­der­able amount of time, but gen­eral­ly neces­si­tates
a partial cleaning up of the machine. Various at­tempts
have, therefore, been made to devise an ar­range­ment whereby
the change can be effected while the paper is being
made. Several <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span>
con­tri­vances have late­ly been in­tro­duced, all similar to
the one shown in Figs. 49 and 50.</p>

<p>In it the frame <i>f</i> carrying the deckle-strap is made to
slide along the rods <i>e</i> by means of the small wheel <i>b</i>, and by
a similar arrangement on the opposite side and geared with
it. The movable apron <i>l</i>, Fig. 49, is wound round the
spindle <i>g</i>, and is kept taut by the cords <i>m</i> connected with
the springs <i>n</i>. As the deckles approach each other, the
excess of apron is wound up, when they are separated it
unwinds again. The flow of pulp is regulated by two slices
<i>a a</i>, which are kept in position by the screws <i>h</i>. The whole
arrangement is securely bolted to the frame of the machine;
<i>c</i> (Fig. 50) represents the breast-roll, and corresponds to F,
Plates I. and II.</p>

<p>The thickness of the paper is regulated by altering the
supply of pulp to the wire-cloth, and by the speed at which
the machine is working. This speed may vary from about
60 feet to as high as 270 feet per minute.</p>

<p>The “wire” is an endless cloth made of very fine wire, the
fineness depending much on the quality of the paper required.
The mesh varies from 60 to 70 and even more threads to the
inch. It is not woven endless, but is joined by very careful
sewing with wire. Its width
varies considerably, some <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
being made as wide as 126 inches; the length is generally
35–40 ft. It is carried by the breast-roll F, the lower couch-roll
G, and the small rolls <span class="nowrap"><i>f&#x200a;′</i>,</span>
and by a large number of
small rolls <span class="nowrap"><i>f&#x200a;″</i>.</span>
The latter and the breast-roll are supported
by the frame <i>g</i>, while the small rolls
<span class="nowrap"><i>f&#x200a;′</i></span> are supported by
brackets attached to it. The course of the wire is indicated
by the arrows. The frame <i>g</i> works on two pivots <i>g′</i>, and receives
a shaking motion from side to side from the rod <i>j</i>, in
connection with a crank worked by two conical drums H.
The supports <i>g″</i> are also pivoted at their lower ends to allow
for the shaking motion. This shaking motion is given for
the purpose of weaving or intertwining the fibres. One or
more of the rolls <span class="nowrap"><i>f&#x200a;′</i></span>
can be moved up or down on the support
which carries it, for the purpose of stretching the wire.
There is usually a large number of the small rolls
<span class="nowrap"><i>f&#x200a;″</i>,</span> as it
has been found by experience that, probably owing to
capillary attraction, they, cause the water to leave the pulp.
Though a large quantity of water thus passes through the
wire-cloth, it is necessary to assist it by artificial means.
This is done by means of the suction-boxes I connected by
pipes with the vacuum-pumps I′.</p>

<p>This part of the machine, which is called the “wet-end,”
is placed at a slight slope of about 1 in. in its entire length,
the lowest end being nearest the strainers.</p>

<p>Underneath the wire-cloth is placed a box called the
“save-all” K, connected with the box E′. The water that
passes through the wire-cloth contains a considerable quantity
of very fine fibres, together with size, alum, clay, and
colouring materials, that have passed through the wire, and
which would be lost but for the arrangement now universally
adopted. It flows into the box E′, and is pumped, together
with the pulp that has passed through the knotter E (see
p. <a href="#p151" title="go to p. 151">151</a>), into the high box B, whence the mixed stuff flows
on the sand-tables, to be again used to dilute fresh pulp from
the stuff-chests. The following numbers will give some idea
of the nature and amount of fibre, &#x26;c.,
which passes through. <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
The paper was made from esparto and straw, sized with rosin
and starch. It contained 12 per cent. of clay.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>It is almost impossible to utilise the whole of the back-water
passing through the wire-cloth in the way described.
In some mills a portion of this water is made to pass through
a “pulp-saver,” such as is shown in Figs. 51 and 52. It
consists of a conical drum A, the circumference of which is
covered with wire-cloth, and it is caused to revolve slowly
by suitable gearing. The water enters by the pipe B, and
passes through the meshes of the wire-cloth, the pulp gradually
finding its way to the wider end, where it is discharged
into the box C. It can then be returned to the beaters.</p>

<p>This pulp-saver can also be used for recovering the fibre
from other waste water, such as the wash water from the
washing and beating-engines; or it can be used for freeing
bleached pulp from water in cases where drainage or hydraulic
pressure is not resorted to.</p>

<p>If any pattern or name is required on the paper, it is produced
by means of a light skeleton roll, called a “dandy-roll,”
covered with raised wires in the form of
the desired pattern, <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span>
placed between the suction-boxes, and pressing lightly on
the still moist paper. The paper is thinned where the wire
pattern presses, and thus a mark (water-mark) is produced.
The other side of the paper has a mark corresponding to the
wire-cloth; by using a dandy-roll covered with wire-cloth,
the two sides can be obtained alike, such paper going by the
name of “wove.”</p>

<p>Paper in which a series of parallel lines are produced is
called a “laid” paper.</p>

<p>Some water-marks are produced by means of a dandy-roll
in which the pattern is formed by depressions in the surface.
The paper is thus <i>thicker</i> where the pattern is formed than in
the ground-work. De la Rue (Patent No. 8348, 1884) has
patented the use of dandy-rolls so formed as to produce upon
the paper the effects both of thickening and thinning.</p>

<p>Imitation water-marks can be produced on the finished
paper by subjecting it to pressure in contact with plates on
which the design has been produced in relief. In this
way very beautiful results can be obtained. (See Patent
No. 13,455, 1884.)</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the wire-cloth slips slightly to
one side. This can be obviated by the machine-man shifting,
by means of screws, one of the rolls provided for the purpose
with a movable journal, until its axis is at a slight angle to
that of the other rolls. An automatic apparatus has been invented
for this purpose. Two brass plates are fixed, one on
each side of the wire-cloth, to a long rod, connected by suitable
machinery with the screws working the movable journal,
so that, as the wire presses against one or the other of these
plates, the roll is shifted so as to correct this.</p>

<p>The paper, which, even after passing the suction-boxes, is
still very wet, passes with the wire-cloth between the couch-rolls
G&#xa0;G′. These are hollow copper or brass cylinders,
covered with a tightly-fitting endless jacket of felt. They
may also be made of wood (sycamore or mahogany) or of
iron or iron and brass combined. The pressure of the upper
couch-roll upon the lower can be regulated
by means of <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
screws or levers. They serve to press out water from the
paper, and to detach the paper from the wire-cloth. By
dexterous manipulation on the part of the machine-men, the
paper is transferred to the endless felt, travelling over the
rolls <i>k</i> in the direction of the arrows. It is known as
the “wet felt,” from the condition of the paper at this
stage. In its passage along this felt, the paper passes between
two iron rolls K, called the first press-rolls, with the
object of having the water squeezed or pressed out of it.
These rolls are sometimes covered with a thin brass case, and
the top one is provided with an arrangement called the
“doctor,” in order to keep it clean, and free from pieces of
paper that may have stuck to it. The lower press roll is
sometimes covered with an indiarubber jacket. The “doctor”
is a kind of knife placed along the whole length of the
roll, and pressing against it at every point. The pressure
on the rolls can be regulated by means of levers, or, as in
the illustration, by the screw <i>k′</i>. It will be readily seen
that the under side of the paper that has been next to the
felt will, in its still moist condition, have taken to some
extent an impression from the felt, while the upper side will
have been made comparatively smooth by the pressure
against the top roll of the 1st press. In order to make
both sides of the paper as nearly as possible alike, it is
passed through another set of rolls L, called the 2nd press.
This time it is reversed, and enters at the back of the rolls;
thus the other side of the paper is next the metal, being
taken through by the felt (called the “2nd press felt”)
travelling on the small rolls <i>l</i>, the paper, after leaving the
wet felt, and before being taken on to the 2nd press felt,
travels over the rolls <i>l′</i>. The 2nd press felt is necessary,
because the paper is too tender to withstand, unsupported,
the pressure of the rolls.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/i158.png" width="600" height="331" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
53.</div></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>The paper, after passing the 2nd press rolls, travels over
the drying-cylinders M, the number of which varies somewhat.
In the machine shown, there are in all eight cylinders.
Sometimes as many as twelve are
employed. Between the <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
2nd press rolls and the cylinders, a passage S allows easy
access to the other side of the machine. The paper generally
passes alone over the first two, which are only slightly heated;
afterwards it is led over the others by means of felts, as
shown. The arrangements shown at R are for the purpose of
stretching the felts. The cylinders are heated by means of
steam, and are generally divided into two sets, between
which is a pair of chilled-iron, highly-polished rolls N, called
“smoothers,” the function of which is sufficiently explained by
their name. They are also heated by means of steam. The
cylinders are usually made of slightly decreasing diameter,
in order to allow for the shrinking of the paper on drying.
Messrs. G. &#x26; W. Bertram introduce into some of their
machines one or two small drying cylinders, over which the
2nd press felt travels, the object being to drive off some of
the moisture absorbed from the paper. This contrivance is
said to give excellent results, and to ensure a considerable
saving in felts. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 53. It is
especially useful in machines running at a high speed, or in
those having limited drying power. After leaving the
cylinders, the paper should be quite dry; it is then led
through the calenders, of which there are
in some machines <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span>
as many as three sets, though only one is shown. These
are similar to the smoothing-rolls, just described. Pressure
is applied by the screws O′, or by levers and weights.
The friction of the hot calenders on the dry paper develops
a large quantity of electricity, which occasionally discharges
itself in bright sparks.</p>

<p>It is the practice in some mills to cool the paper before
passing it through the calenders. This is effected by passing
it over a copper cylinder, through which a stream of cold
water runs.</p>

<p>The degree of smoothness or “finish” that can be given to
the paper by the calenders, depends to a large extent upon
the degree of moisture which it contains. As it leaves the
last cylinder it is perfectly dry, that is to say, it contains
only that amount of water which cellulose, from whatever
source, always carries. This amount varies slightly with
the nature of the cellulose, and with the plant from which it
has been isolated, and also with the state of the atmosphere,
it being greater on damp days. It would be impossible so
to regulate the drying action of the cylinders that the
requisite amount of water should always be left in the paper;
it is therefore better to dry it as thoroughly as possible, and
then to add the water, by artificial means, just before it
passes through the calenders. This method, moreover, has
the advantage of damping only the surface of the paper.</p>

<p>Fig. 54 shows a damping arrangement as manufactured
by Messrs. James Bertram &#x26; Son. The paper on leaving
the last drying cylinder passes on to two copper cylinders <i>c</i>,
filled with cold water. Steam passes through the pipe <i>a</i>, and
issues through a number of fine holes in a pipe running at
right angles to the direction in which the paper is travelling,
and near to it. The steam condenses on the paper and on
the surface of the cylinders, from which the paper absorbs it.
The supply can be regulated by the cocks shown in the
drawing. The troughs <i>d</i> carry off any excess of condensed
water.</p>

<p>Amongst other methods proposed is one
by Annandale; it <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
consists in breaking up jets of water into a very fine spray
by means of a blast of air.</p>

<p>The finished paper, after passing through the calenders, is
wound on the reels P. The gearing by which the whole
machine is driven is shown in Plate II.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that, owing to the increased tension
due to the contraction of the paper in drying, the paper
breaks. It is therefore necessary to alter the speed of some
of the cylinders to compensate for this. A rough expedient
which is largely adopted, consists in attaching, by means
of a mixture of rosin and tallow, a piece of felt to one or
other of the pulleys (Plate II.), and thus altering its speed.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3
class="h3inlineit">Tub-sizing.</h3>—The fore­going
de­scrip­tion is of a ma­chine for the man­u­fac­ture of
en­gine-sized papers; some slight mod­i­fi­ca­tions are
neces­sary in the case of papers that are tub-sized on the
machine. In making the cheaper qualities of tub-sized
papers, the paper, after being partially dried over a few
cylinders, is passed through a ves­sel con­tain­ing a <span
class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span> solution of gelatine
(see p. <a href="#p162" title="go to p. 162">162</a>).
It then goes between a pair of rollers,
which press out the excess of size, and then again over
drying-cylinders. The vessel or trough containing the size
is filled to overflowing from a tank placed at a higher
level; the overflow passes into a lower vessel, from which
it is pumped up to the top tank. The size is kept warm by
means of a coil through which steam passes placed in one
or other of the vessels containing it. The paper passes
between a pair of rollers placed in a trough and dipping
into the size. The size may be made to flow through a
pipe pierced with a number of holes, the stream running
directly on to the web of paper. In the other, and perhaps
most general way, at least for the better qualities, the
paper is wound off immediately after leaving the last
drying-cylinder A (Fig. 55), and sized at some future time,
or it may be passed directly into the vat B containing the
size. After passing between the squeezing-rolls. C, it is
generally wound off as at D; and after having stood some
time <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span> to allow
the size to be evenly absorbed by the paper, it is wound
off from F, and passed over the cylinders H, of which
there may be a very great number, some machines having
over 300 of them. These cylinders are made of light spars
of wood; inside them, and revolving rapidly in an opposite
direction, are the fans G. The paper, in travelling over
these drums, is only slowly dried, and is supposed by
this means to be more perfectly sized, and increased in
strength. It is wound on to reels again at I. Only the
first and last two drums are shown. This method was devised
to imitate, as far as possible, the sizing process of
hand-made paper. Even now, paper that has been made on
the machine is sized by hand, after having been cut into
sheets, much in the same way as hand-made.<br class="clearfix" /></div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Preparation of Size.</h3>—Very
pure gelatine can now be obtained
in the form of light-coloured cakes. It is, however,
more economical for the paper-maker to prepare his own:
this is therefore done in the majority of cases. A great many
animal substances, such as clippings of hides, horns, bones,
&#x26;c., yield gelatine when heated with water. Any of these
substances may be used, the first being the chief raw
material. They are first softened by soaking in cold water
for some days: they are then cleansed by washing in a stream
of water. The next operation is that of heating with water.
This is usually done in iron or copper vessels provided with
a false bottom or outer jacket, into which steam may be
passed. The hide cuttings are covered with water, and the
mass gradually raised to a temperature of about 85° (185°&#x2005;F.).
In from 10 to 15 hours nearly the whole of the cuttings will
have passed into solution as gelatine. This solution is then
drawn off and any insoluble substance suspended in it is removed
by subsidence or filtration. The hides contain a certain
quantity of fat, which collects on the surface of the solution. The
residue in the boiler is again heated with water and the solution
added to the bulk. It is of the greatest importance that
too high a temperature be avoided, as gelatine is liable, when
strongly heated with water, to lose its
power of gelatinising. <span class="xxpn" id="p163">{163}</span></div>

<p>To the filtered solution of gelatine, which should be, if
properly prepared, of a pale colour, a quantity of alum solution
is added. The effect of alum upon gelatine is very
remarkable. If added slowly it will be found gradually to
render it stiff until at a certain point the mass will become
almost solid; a further addition renders it fluid again. It is
in this state ready to be used for sizing purposes. The amount
of alum necessary to produce this effect is about 20 per cent.
of the weight of the raw material. The alum is also useful
in preventing the decomposition of the gelatine, but its chief
characteristic is to render the gelatine a more efficient sizing
material. There is no doubt that, besides its action upon
the gelatine itself, it has a considerable effect upon cellulose.
It is of the greatest importance that the alum or the sulphate
of alumina, which can be substituted, should not contain any
free acid. This is especially necessary in the case of papers
made from rags, in the bleaching of which an acid has been
used; one effect of which is to remove all basic substances
derived from the boiling or bleaching processes. In the case
of esparto and similar fibres, a considerable quantity of such
substances are present in the pulp, the result being that the
free acid of alum is to a large extent neutralised, and its
injurious effects prevented.</p>

<p>The effect of the free acid is seen in the weakening of the
paper and the destruction of metal surfaces with which it
comes in contact. The effect of acid upon cellulose will be
found more fully described in p. <a href="#p012" title="go to p. 12">12</a>.</p>

<p>Many paper-makers add to the gelatine a certain quantity
of soap, the effect of which is to render the paper capable of
taking a high finish. The soaps employed should be white
and firm, and should be free from rosin. Some soap-makers
prepare a special soap for paper-making. They are usually
made from tallow, or a mixture of this with a small quantity
of coconut oil.</p>

<p>If a solution of soap be added to one of alum, a double
decomposition immediately occurs, the fatty acid being
thrown down in combination with the alumina,
and the soda <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
combining with the sulphuric acid. If, however, the soap
solution be previously mixed with a solution of gelatine, no
precipitation takes place, the mixture forming an emulsion
having somewhat the appearance of thin milk.</p>

<p>Various attempts have from time to time been made to size
paper in the engine with gelatine, by precipitating it in the
pulp after the manner of rosin sizing, but as yet no successful
method has been devised.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Single-cylinder
Machines.</h3>—Modified forms of the original Fourdrinier
machine have been introduced to meet various requirements.
One suitable for the manufacture of very thin paper, or of
papers one side only of which is required to be glazed,
called a single-cylinder or Yankee machine, is shown in
Fig. 56.</div>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/i164.png" width="600" height="244" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
56.</div></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>It resembles the Fourdrinier machine as far as the couch-rolls
A and B. The paper is taken off the wire-cloth on to an
endless felt running round the upper couch-roll A, and
travelling in the direction of the arrows. It is taken from
the felt on to the large drying-cylinder C, of about 10 feet
diameter, heated with steam. It is carefully turned and
polished so as to impart a high gloss to the surface of the
paper with which it is in contact. Calender-rolls are sometimes
supplied in addition.</p>

<p>The arrangement shown at D is for the purpose of washing
the felt. This is necessary to cool and open it out after
passing between the cold press-roll E and
the hot cylinder. <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span></p>

<p>The paper, after passing over the greater part of the
surface of the cylinder, is sufficiently dried, and it is then
wound off at F.</p>

<div class="dfloatright dwth-c">
<img src="images/i165.png" width="370" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
57.</div></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>A machine of a very dif­fer­ent con­struc­tion from the
or­di­nary form is shown in Fig. 57. The pulp, after passing
through the strainer A, enters the vat B, in the centre of
which a large drum or cylinder C revolves. This cylinder is
covered with fine wire-cloth, and on it the paper is made.
As it revolves, the fibres attach themselves to the wire,
and the water passes through the meshes, being assisted by
means of a pump. The sheet of paper thus formed is taken
on to the endless felt passing round the couch-roll D,
and travels along with it to the large drying-cylinder
E, heated by steam. It leaves the felt at F, and is then
taken on to the cylinder, after travelling round which it
is sufficiently dried, and is then wound off as at G. The
felt on its return journey passes through the washer H,
where it is cleaned and freed from adhering particles by
the scraper I. It is squeezed free from excess of <span
class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span> water by the rolls K.
Paper made on such a machine is weaker than that made in
the ordinary way, because it has not been found possible to
give a shaking motion to the cylinder, and thus the fibres
are only imperfectly felted.</p>

<p>A modification of this machine is used for making millboards, the
difference being that it has no drying-cylinder. The felt carrying
the paper passes between a pair of press-rolls, which squeeze out
the water. The sheet of paper is then allowed to wind round the top
press-roll until of the required thickness. When this happens, it is
cut off the roll by a knife. The thick sheets so produced are dried
either in the open air or in a room heated for the purpose. (See p.

<p>One method, called “web glazing,” is to pass the paper
between a number of rolls, alternately of polished iron and
very highly compressed paper or cotton. The construction
of such a calender will be understood by reference to Figs. 58
(end elevation) and 59 (front elevation). The reel of paper,
as taken from the machine, is shown at A (Fig. 58), its course
over the rolls being indicated by arrows. After passing over
the bottom roll, it is wound off on a wooden or hollow iron
cylinder B (Fig. 58), driven by the toothed wheel shown by
the dotted line C, on the same shaft as the wheel D, which
is driven by E, keyed upon the bottom roll. The whole machinery
is driven by the large toothed wheel F (Figs. 58 and
59), which is itself driven by the small wheel G on the main
shaft H. The paper rolls are marked P, and the iron rolls I.
It will be seen that there are two paper rolls in the middle,
for the purpose of, as it were, reversing the paper, and so
making both sides alike. Pressure is applied to the rolls by
means of the screws K, and by the weight L (Fig. 58) acting
on the compound lever M. The brake, which consists of a
strap of leather, pressing, by means of the weight and lever N,
on the circumference of the wheel O, connected by toothed
wheels with the cylinder A on which the paper is wound, is
used for the purpose of preventing the
paper from leaving <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
the cylinder too rapidly. But for this appliance, the paper
would be apt to crease. The paper rolls have an inner core
of iron, the paper only extending to a depth of about 5 in.
The iron rolls are hollow, and are connected with steam-pipes,
by which they
can be heated. <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span></p>

<p>Another method, known as “friction-glazing,” employed
for giving a very high finish to paper, generally on one side
only, is to pass it between a large paper roll and a smaller
iron one, the latter revolving at a much greater
speed than the <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
former. By this means a very smooth surface can be obtained.
It is sometimes assisted by rubbing a small quantity of
bees’-wax on the small iron roll. The above-mentioned
methods apply to the glazing of paper in the web. Paper cut
into sheets may also be treated in the same way. Various
modifications of these calenders have been devised; they do
not, however, involve the application of any special principle.
Plate-glazing, a method that is adapted to hand-made and
the better qualities of paper, consists in applying heavy
pressure to sheets placed between polished plates of copper
or zinc. The metallic plates and the sheets of paper are
made into bundles, and the whole is passed between two
strong rolls, heavy pressure being communicated to them
by means of screws or levers and weights applied to the ends
of the upper roll.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/i170.png" width="600" height="461" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
60.</div></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>A calender for this purpose is shown in Fig. 60. The
bundle of plates and paper is passed along the
table <i>a</i>; after <span class="xxpn" id="p171">{171}</span>
passing through the rolls <i>c</i>, it slides along the inclined table <i>d</i>,
where it is received by a workman. The pressure on the
rolls is regulated by the handle <i>e</i> and the weights <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>By passing paper between rolls on which devices have been
cut, the “repped” and other similar papers are produced.</p>

<p>With calender rolls of the ordinary construction, as the
pressure is applied at the extreme ends, the roll is liable to
assume a slightly curved shape, the effect of which is to produce
an uneven surface on the paper, the outer portion of
the web being more highly finished than the centre.</p>

<div class="dctr05">

<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
61.</div></div><!--dctr05-->

<p>This defect is obviated to a very large extent by Schurmann’s
Patent Anti-Deflection Rolls (Fig. 61). The roll
proper consists of an outer shell <i>a</i>, through the centre of
which and securely wedged in at <i>b</i> is the centre core <i>c</i>, the
ends of which run in journals, and to which pressure is
applied in the usual way. The pressure is communicated to
the outer shell at the point of contact <i>b</i>, the result being
that the parallelism of the surfaces of the rolls is maintained,
and in consequence, the paper tends to be equally finished
in every direction.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Cutting.</h3>—Except
for special purposes, such, for example,
as for use in a continuous printing machine, paper is usually
sent from the mill in the form of sheets. The form of cutter,
called a revolving cutter, generally used, is shown in Fig. 62.
The paper from the webs A is drawn forward by the rolls B;
it is then ripped into widths of a convenient size by means
of two circular knives, the upper one of which is shown at C.
It again passes between a pair of rollers, after leaving which
it meets a knife D fastened to the revolving drum E, and
pressing against a fixed knife not shown.
The cut sheets <span class="xxpn" id="p172">{172}</span>
then fall upon the endless travelling felt F. The action of
the knives will be understood by reference to Fig. 63. The
edges of the two knives are shown at A and B. The knife B
has a slot, in which the bolt D slides, and it is kept in
position by means of a spring. This spring causes the knife
to slide back slightly as it comes against the fixed knife A.
The position of the paper is shown by the dotted line C.
The knife B is set on the drum not quite horizontally, so
that one end meets the stationary knife a little before the
other, thus acting in every respect like a pair of scissors.
Fig. 64 shows a pair of ripping-knives. The upper one A is
kept in position against the lower one B by means of the
spring C. The cutting surfaces are slightly hollowed out,
so as to have a sharper edge. The paper is shown by the
dotted line D. By altering the relative speed of
the drum E <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span>
and the rolls B, by means of the expanding pulley G, sheets
of any desired size can be cut. The cutting-knives are
sometimes placed inclined to the drawing-in rolls B, so that
the sheet, instead of being cut into a rectangle, is cut into a
rhomboid. Such paper is used chiefly for the manufacture
of envelopes, this shape occasioning a smaller loss when the
envelopes are cut out.</div></div><!--section-->

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Single-sheet Cutter.</h3>—It
is sometimes necessary, as in the case
of paper having a water-mark, that the sheet should be cut
with great exactness, so that the device shall come exactly
in the centre. The ordinary cutter cannot be relied on for
this purpose, and, in its place, a machine called a “single-sheet
cutter” is used (Fig. 65). It consists essentially of a
large wooden drum A, fixed on a horizontal axis, over which
the paper is led by a pair of drawing-in rolls B. The paper is
held against the drum by a clamp worked by the arm C.
The paper is cut by the knife E moving against the stationary
knife D. After the cut, the drum describes part of a circle,
the paper being still held, so that it cannot go back with the
drum. As soon as it has gone far enough, the clamp is removed,
and the drum returns, bringing the paper with it.
The length of the arc through which the drum moves, and
therefore the size of sheet, is regulated by the length of the
crank-arm F. If from any cause the cut
should not take <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
place at the right time, the man in charge can, by pressing
against the clamp, retard the motion of the paper, and thus
bring back the cut to the right place. The small roller G is
for the purpose of keeping the paper always tight.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Guillotine
Cutter.</h3>—It is sometimes necessary to trim the edges
of sheets of paper or to divide them into smaller sheets.
This is done by means of a guillotine cutter, an improved
form of which, as manufactured by Salmon of Manchester, and
called the “Victory” cutter, is shown in Fig. 66.</div>

<p>The paper to be cut is placed on the table F, touching the
back gauge G, which can be brought backwards or forwards
by means of the handle H, thus regulating the size of sheet.</p>

<p>The machine is set in motion by means of the lever A,
which acts upon a friction-clutch connected with the driving-gear.
This causes the knife-bar B and the clamp
C to descend. <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>
When the latter meets the paper its progress is arrested.
The knife D, however, continues to descend, and passes
through the sheets of paper. By means of slots placed at the
back, the knife is made to take a diagonal course. The pressure
of the clamp is maintained upon the paper during the
cutting operation by means of a powerful spring contained in
the tube E.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Sorting.</h3>—The
sheets of paper are now ready to be examined
before being finally sent away from the mill. This is done in
the “Finishing-house,” or “Salle” as it is sometimes called.
This sorting is usually performed by women, who reject the
inferior or damaged sheets. These are sold at a reduced price
under the name of “retree.”</div>

<p>Paper is sold in sheets of definite sizes, and is made
up into reams containing from 480 to 516 sheets. These
sizes <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span> correspond
to different trade names—such, for example, as crown, demy,
royal, imperial, &#x26;c. The weight per ream is usually
expressed in addition to the name, thus: 14-lb. demy,
18-lb. double crown, &#x26;c. In this way the consumer is
enabled to make a rough comparison of the thickness of the
different kinds of paper.</p>

<p>In making paper it is the duty of the machineman to
examine and weigh from time to time a sheet of the desired
size, in order to ensure uniformity. Special lever balances
can be obtained, showing at a glance the weight per
ream of different numbers of sheets.</p>

CHAPTER XII.
<span class="hsmall">
CAUSTIC SODA, RECOVERED SODA,
<span class="smcap">E<b>TC.</b></span></span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">As we have already pointed out, caustic soda and lime are
the only alkalis employed by the paper-maker for boiling
fibres; the special cases in which carbonate of soda is used
have been mentioned in their proper place.</p>

<p>The preparation of milk of lime requires little or no de­scrip­tion,
as the operation is a simple and tolerably familiar
one. Before using, it should be passed through a fine wire
sieve, to keep back sand, coal, and similar impurities which
the lime invariably contains.</p>

<p>Caustic soda is met with in commerce in four forms, differing
from each other in alkaline strength and colour, and
of course in price. The lowest quality is what is known as
caustic “bottoms”: it consists of that portion remaining at
the bottom of the caustic-pot after the clear fused caustic soda
has been ladled out, and it contains a considerable quantity
of ferric oxide and other insoluble impurities. It is of a
dark reddish brown colour, and contains 50–60 per cent. of
alkali (Na<sub>2</sub>O). Its use in paper-making cannot be recommended,
except for the preparation of the very lowest grade
of pulp. The solution should be allowed to remain at rest, in
order that the insoluble matter may subside.</p>

<p>The next in quality is known as cream caustic, so called
from its slightly brown colour. It is usually sold containing
60 per cent. of alkali, in the form of a tolerably friable mass,
having a crystalline structure. It is a very suitable form of
alkali for the paper-maker.</p>

<p>The next in order is what is called 60 per
cent. white. It <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span>
consists of a hard white mass, requiring considerable force to
break it. Though whiter in appearance than cream caustic,
it is in reality less pure, as it contains a considerable quantity
of salt. It is made by continuing the evaporation of the
caustic liquor to a further point than is the case with cream
caustic, the result being that the whole of the water is driven
off. A small quantity of nitre is then added to oxidise the
sulphides and other compounds which impart the colour to
cream caustic. Common salt is then added to reduce its
strength to 60 per cent., in order to satisfy the whim of the
consumer, who insists upon an article of a given definite
strength. On this account it is somewhat inferior to cream
caustic, and is, moreover, more expensive.</p>

<p>The highest quality of all is white 70 per cent. This
resembles white 60 per cent. in appearance, but is much
purer, and more expensive.</p>

<p>A very pure form of caustic soda has within the last few
years been introduced by the Greenbank Alkali Company. It
consists of small fragments, more or less crystalline, of almost
pure sodium hydrate. It can be packed in wooden casks,
and it dissolves very readily in water. It contains 76 per
cent. of alkali. It is, however, much too costly for boiling
purposes; it might, however, be used for the preparation of
rosin size.</p>

<p>The following analyses of different forms of caustic soda
and their relative prices will possibly be of <span class="nowrap">interest:—</span></p>

<p>Their relative prices per ton f.o.b Liverpool, in December
1886, were:—70 per cent. white, 8<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>; 60 per cent. white,
7<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>; 60 per cent. cream, 7<i>l.</i></p>

<p>All the above-mentioned forms of caustic soda occur in the
form of more or less hard masses, and are contained in thin
wrought-iron drums, which are filled with the caustic in a
fused state. The soda is removed by breaking the drum
with a chisel and hammer. The lumps of caustic may be
put direct into the boiler, though it is better to dissolve
them previously in water and allow any insoluble impurities
to settle to the bottom of the solution.</p>

<p>Instead of buying caustic soda direct, it is the custom of
some paper-makers to prepare it for themselves from carbonate
of soda, which can now be obtained in various forms,
some of great purity.</p>

<p>It occurs as caustic ash, containing about 40 per cent. of
alkali as carbonate, and about 10 per cent. as caustic soda;
soda-ash containing about 52 per cent. total alkali, nearly all
as carbonate; and refined soda-ash containing 57–58 per cent.
of alkali as carbonate. Some forms of carbonate of soda,
such, for example, as those made by the ammonia process, are
of even greater purity. The method of converting sodium
carbonate into caustic soda will be described subsequently.</p>

<p>Unless the arrangements for washing and draining the
lime-mud are very perfect, it is probably cheaper for the
paper-maker to buy his caustic direct from the maker.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Soda Recovery.</h3>—In
former years, the liquors in which
rags, esparto, and other paper material had been boiled, was
run into the nearest watercourse; but now, owing partly to the
fact that is insisted upon by the Rivers Pollution Act of 1876,
and partly because it can be made remunerative, all these
liquors are preserved, and the soda they contain utilised.
The method adopted is to evaporate to dryness and ignite the
residue. The soda during the process of boiling takes up a
large amount of non-cellulose fibre constituents and dissolves
them as resinous compounds. These on evaporation and
ignition become converted into sodium
carbonate. Many raw <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span>
materials, especially esparto and straw, contain a large amount
of silica, a large proportion of which is dissolved by the soda
in the form of sodium silicate, in which form also it is found
in the recovered soda.</div>

<p>The apparatus for ac­com­plish­ing the evap­o­ra­tion varies
with almost every mill. In some, it is very primitive
and <span class="xxpn" id="p181">{181}</span> crude,
consisting perhaps of only a furnace for incinerating the
residue, and over it a pan containing the liquor, the
latter being heated and evaporated by the heat from the
furnace. It is obvious that, with such an arrangement, a
large quantity of heat must be wasted. To economise as
much as possible of this waste heat, various plans have
been suggested. That of Rœckner, of Newcastle, appears to
be to a great extent efficacious. It consists practically
of a series of shallow trays B (Fig. 67) placed in a
brick chamber, alternated so as to allow the heated air
from the furnace below to play upon the surface of each
in succession, on its way to the chimney, with which the
whole system is in connection. Above the chamber containing
these trays, is a large tank C, containing a store of the
liquor to be evaporated, placed there so as still further
to economise the heat, and from which the liquor runs on to
the trays. The furnace A is of the ordinary re­ver­ber­a­tory
kind; below it, and connected with it by a kind of damper,
is a large chamber J, where the calcined residue from the
furnace is put to cool, thus preventing any nuisance from
the smell of the burning mass. The chamber is provided
with a pipe L, through which the vapours pass into the
furnace. Several pipes E from the furnace pass through the
<span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span> tank, to assist
in warming the liquor. The residue, when cold, is drawn
through doors from the chamber below the furnace. Rœckner
has devised an apparatus (Fig. 68), consisting of a small
chamber containing a series of pipes A, through which a
stream of cold water constantly runs, in connection with
the flue from his evaporator, for the purpose of condensing
volatile bodies, and thus preventing, to a certain extent,
contamination of the surrounding air.</p>

<p>A very economical form of evaporator is that invented by
Porion, a French distiller, and named after him. It is shown
in sectional elevation and plan in Figs. 69 and 70. It is
largely used on the Continent, and also in England and
Scotland. It consists of a large chamber <i>k</i>, the floor of
which is slightly inclined from the chimney shaft, and
through which the waste heat from the furnace <i>a</i> passes.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="images/i182.png" width="690" height="470" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
 69.<div><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>
 70.</div></div></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>The liquor to be evaporated is run in at the end nearest the
chimney from the tank placed above the chamber <i>c</i>. A
number of cast-iron fanners <i>i</i>, dip into the liquor and revolve
rapidly, usually at the rate of about
300 revolutions per <span class="xxpn" id="p183">{183}</span>
minute, producing and filling the chamber with a very fine
spray, thus presenting a very large evaporating surface.</p>

<p>Between the furnace and the evaporator are placed the
chambers <i>c</i> and <i>f</i>. In <i>c</i> a number of brick walls <i>d</i> are so
placed that the flames from the furnace are intercepted and
broken up. The object of this is to give time for all the
products of combustion to be thoroughly burnt up, which
would not be the case without the “smell-consumer,” as
these chambers are called. This part is an addition to the
original evaporator, and was devised by Messrs. Menzies and
Davis. The liquor after having been concentrated in the
chamber <i>k</i> runs into a trough placed alongside the doors <i>h</i> and
flows into one or other of the furnace beds <i>b</i> where it is still
further concentrated, and the residue ignited by the flames
from the fires <i>a</i>. The draught can be regulated by the
damper <i>g</i>, and also by one placed near the shaft <i>j</i>. The doors
<i>e</i>, in the smell-consuming chamber, are for the purpose of
cleaning out. The fanners <i>i</i> are worked by a small steam
engine, not shown in the drawing. Under properly regulated
conditions very excellent results can be obtained with
this evaporator. The temperature of the gases near the
chimney should not be higher than about 85°. By running
the fanners at a very high speed the temperature of the gases
may be even further reduced, thus showing the completeness
of the evaporation.</p>

<p>This form of evaporator is open to the objection that the
whole of the sulphur in the coal employed for the furnaces,
finds its way into the recovered soda. It combines with the
alkali to form sulphite of soda, part of which is decomposed
in the furnace with formation of sodium sulphate, sulphide,
and other sulphur compounds. The same objection, of course,
applies, though perhaps in a less degree, to all systems of
evaporation in which the flame is in contact with the liquor
to be evaporated.</p>

<p>The Porion evaporator can be erected at very small cost, and
costs but little for maintenance. It is capable of producing
<sup>3</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub> ton of
recovered soda per ton of coal with liquors <span class="xxpn"
id="p184">{184}</span> of the usual strength. It has proved
itself to be perhaps the most economical evaporator existing.</p>

<p>Some time ago there was erected in Lancashire an evaporator
invented and patented by Mr. Alfred Chapman. It is shown
in Figs. 71, 72, 73, and 74. The evaporation is effected at a
low temperature in three vacuum pans E, and with the unusual
result that the concentrated liquor gelatinises after
leaving the third vacuum-pan, instead of taking the ordinary
form of the concentrated products of other evaporators. It
is said that this apparatus gives an excellent product, with
great economy of labour and water, and with no drainage
of foul liquor from the buildings. Observations extending
over three months have proved that it evaporates 22 lb. of
water from the liquor per lb. of coal used under the boiler.
It is however very costly to erect.</p>

<p>The waste liquor is discharged into the tank A, whence it is
pumped by the donkey-engine B, through
the feed-heater C, <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span>
into the boiler D, which receives heat from the incinerating
furnace H, and, in case of need, from an auxiliary furnace
shown on the plan, under the feed-liquor-heater. The steam
produced in D is taken to the first vacuum-pan at E, and
having heated its contents, the products of evaporation pass
over into the tubes of the second pan; this, in its turn, gives
up its products of evaporation to the third, whence they go to
the condenser of the vacuum-engine F. Thus the heat from
the furnace H is used for incinerating
the concentrated liquor <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span>
on its bed, for beating the feed-liquor in the feed-heater pipes,
and for making steam out of the liquor itself in the boiler;
this steam finally drives the donkey-pump and vacuum-engine,
and causes the evaporation in the three vacuum-pans
E. One advantage of this evaporator is the fact that the
liquor is evaporated out of contact with the furnace
gases.</p>

<p>Whatever be the method of evaporating or concentrating
the liquor, the final treatment in the furnaces is much the same
in every case. The furnaces shown in Figs. 69 and 70 may
be taken to represent the ordinary form. The concentrated
liquor is run on to either of the beds <i>b</i>, where the last
portions of water are driven off by the heat from the fireplaces
<i>a</i>, and the residual mass is ignited until all the
organic matter contained in the liquors is carbonised and the
soda is converted into carbonate of soda. This takes place in
about 4 hours, according to the degree of concentration of
the liquor as it is run into the furnaces. The running in of
liquor should be done with great care, as explosions sometimes
occur through the sudden liberation of steam on the liquor
coming in contact with the hot beds. The charge should
be allowed to remain in the furnace until it is thoroughly
carbonised and all volatile matters have been driven off,
otherwise a nuisance may be caused when the still burning
mass is exposed to the air. Rœckner’s evaporator is provided
with a special chamber into which the charge is drawn
(J, Fig. 67).</p>

<p>The composition of the recovered soda varies with the
nature of the liquors from which it has been obtained, and, as
has been already pointed out, with the form of evaporator
employed. It consists essentially of carbonate of soda,
together with a certain amount of silicate of soda, if derived
from liquors in which straw or esparto have been boiled,
chloride of sodium, sulphate of soda, sulphite of soda, sulphide
of sodium, and other sulphur compounds, the rest being made
up of carbon and insoluble impurities. The amount of soda
varies from 35 to 45 per cent. (Na<sub>2</sub>O).
The following analysis <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>

<p class="pcontinue">The whole of the soda present as sulphur
compounds is not lost, as a large proportion of it is present as
sodium sulphite, most of which is converted into caustic soda by
the causticising process.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc13" id="fn13">&#x2a;</a>
A certain quantity of potash derived from the mineral constituents of
esparto and straw is always present in recovered soda.</p></div>

<p>A certain amount of soda is carried forward, partly mechanically
and partly volatilised, to the flue leading to the
chimney. This accumulates, and may be from time to time
removed in the form of fine dust. It contains, besides
carbonate of soda, much sulphate and chloride. In two
different samples examined by the authors, the amounts of
soda (Na<sub>2</sub>O) present were 25·0 and 27·1 per cent.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Causticising.</h3>—The
next process consists in converting the sodium carbonate in the
recovered soda into caustic soda.</div>

<p>This operation is known as “causticising,” and consists in
heating a solution of the soda with lime. The decomposition
which takes place is shown in the following <span class="nowrap">equation:—</span></p>

<p class="pcontinue">The recovered soda should be dissolved in
separate vessels. Perhaps the best form of apparatus is a series
of lixiviating tanks such as are used for dissolving the alkali
in black ash. <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span> By this
means a nearly perfect exhaustion of the mass can be effected
with a minimum of labour. Special tanks are sometimes made for
the purpose, provided with mechanical stirrers.</p>

<p>It is essential in dissolving the recovered soda that a high
temperature should be employed, as otherwise a portion of the
soda present as silicate of soda will be lost, as it is only with
difficulty soluble, and requires rather prolonged heating with
water. Whatever the form of apparatus employed it should
be so arranged that, after running off the strong liquor, the
insoluble residue may be further treated with water. In the
case of the vats mentioned above, this process is made continuous,
pure water being run in at one end, and strong liquor
flowing from the other. If other forms are used, the liquor
after settling, may be run off by means of a pipe passing
through the bottom or side of the vessel, and near the bottom,
and consisting of two parts, one long, and one short. The
short part is stationary, and is connected to the longer part
by means of a movable knee joint, allowing it to be deflected.
The liquor having settled sufficiently, the movable limb is
lowered beneath the surface of the liquor which is then
allowed to flow through. As the surface of the liquor falls,
the pipe is gradually lowered. In this way the clear solution
can be run off without disturbing the residue at the bottom.
The open end of the pipe is usually covered with coarse wire
gauze, to keep back insoluble impurities. With properly
calcined recovered soda, the solution should be bright and
almost colourless. If at all brown in colour, and if it has an
empyreumatic odour, it indicates imperfect calcination. The
residue in the dissolving tanks consists chiefly of carbonaceous
matter, together with some soda, insoluble matter, &#x26;c.</p>

<p>The liquor is now ready to be causticised. This should be
done in a separate vessel, although it is the practice in many
mills to perform this operation in the same vessel in which
the solution of the soda has been conducted. A good form
of causticiser can be made from an old egg-shaped boiler, by
cutting it in two
along its length. <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span></p>

<p>It should be provided with two or more vertical steam
pipes, connected at the bottom of the boiler with a horizontal
pipe perforated with numerous holes. The vertical steam
pipes should be furnished with injectors, whereby air is
drawn in, and forced with the steam through the holes
in the horizontal pipe. The stream of air serves the
double purpose of thoroughly agitating the liquor and
of oxidising any sodium sulphide in the recovered soda.
The liquor before causticising should be reduced in strength
to about 20–25 degrees Twaddle, which may be done with the
washings of the residue from the recovered soda, or from the
washings obtained subsequently from the lime-mud. This
strength should never be exceeded, otherwise imperfect
conversion into caustic soda is the result. This is due to the
fact that concentrated solutions of caustic soda react upon
calcium carbonate, forming sodium carbonate, and calcium
hydrate, the reaction being the reverse of that indicated in
the above equation. If the liquors are very strong in
carbonate of soda, and comparatively free from sulphate, they
should not be causticised at much over 20°&#x2005;Twaddle, if they
contain much sulphate, and therefore less carbonate, the
higher strength can with safety be adopted.</p>

<p>The causticising vessel should be provided with a stout
iron cage or basket, into which the lime can be put. This
should be securely fastened to the vessel, and should dip
into the liquid.</p>

<p>The liquor having been properly diluted, is now heated
by means of the steam pipes, and the lime put into its cage.
It should be put in in lumps. As the liquor reaches the
boiling point, the reaction will proceed rapidly, and the
lime will gradually disappear; fresh lumps should be added
if necessary. If the liquor is sufficiently heated the causticising
will be complete in from two to three hours. The
liquor should be tested from time to time; this is usually
done by a workman. He withdraws a sample of the liquor,
and after allowing the calcium carbonate to subside, pours
off a portion of the clear liquid into a
glass vessel. He <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span>
then adds an excess of either sulphuric or hydrochloric
acid. If any effervescence takes place, due to the evolution
of carbonic acid gas, he knows that the operation of
causticising is incomplete; the heating must therefore be
continued. It is difficult, without an undue expenditure
of time and steam, to convert the whole of the soda into
caustic: it should however be so perfect, that on testing
only a very slight effervescence occurs. It is quite easy to
convert as much as 95 per cent. of the soda, or even more.
The actual amount converted can only be ascertained by a
careful analysis of the liquor.</p>

<p>The amount of lime used is generally somewhat in excess of
the theoretical quantity; 106 parts of sodium carbonate
(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) require 56 parts of lime (CaO): it is necessary, however,
to add about 60 parts. A very good plan is to conduct
two or even three causticisings in the same vessel without
cleaning out or removing the calcium carbonate, using in
the first operation a large excess of lime. The causticising
being completed, the calcium carbonate and excess of lime
are allowed to settle down, and the clear liquor run off by
an arrangement such as that already described in the
dissolving process. Fresh solution is then run in and the
whole mass heated for some time, until the excess of lime is
converted into carbonate. Fresh lime is then added if
necessary until the conversion of the carbonate of soda is
complete. The liquor is then allowed to settle, and is run
off as before: this operation may again be repeated.</p>

<p>The residual calcium carbonate, or “lime-mud” as it is
called in alkali works, is then washed once or twice by
running in water, boiling up, allowing to settle, and running
off the clear liquor. If these liquors are too weak for use in
boiling fibres, they may be used for diluting fresh recovered
soda liquor before causticising, or for dissolving the soda.</p>

<p>Some arrangement should be provided for removing as
much as possible of the liquor from the lime-mud before
throwing it away or otherwise disposing of it. This is best
done by throwing it on a filter made of
layers of stones, <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span>
ashes and sand, and covered at the top with perforated iron
plates. The filter is connected with a vacuum pump. In
this way very perfect draining is ac­com­plished, and the mud
forms a hard mass on the surface of the filter, from which
it can be easily removed with spades. In this form it contains
only 50–60 per cent. of water. If properly washed it
should contain in this state only about 2 per cent. of alkali
(Na<sub>2</sub>O). By careful manipulation, even this amount can be
reduced.</p>

<p>The importance of thoroughly washing the mud can hardly
be too much insisted upon. Where proper means are not
employed for draining, the washing should be made more
perfect. The lime-mud consists chiefly of carbonate of lime,
together with silicate, free lime, &#x26;c. The following analysis
is of a mud obtained by causticising recovered soda derived
from the liquors in which esparto and straw had been
<span class="nowrap">boiled:—</span></p>

<p>As already pointed out the liquors contain a certain amount
of soda, as sodium sulphide and other sulphur compounds.
The presence of the former, if in large quantities, is objectionable,
as it is liable to discolour fibres boiled in liquors containing
it. It is therefore best to remove it. This can be
conveniently done by blowing air into the liquors during the
process of causticising: this has the effect of oxidising it to
sulphate of soda, in which form it is harmless.</p>

<p>The air can of course be blown into the liquor by means of
a pump; the most economical way is to connect with the
steam pipe an injector constructed on the principle of the
injectors used for feeding boilers and for other purposes.
By this means a strong current of air is
drawn in, and <span class="xxpn" id="p192">{192}</span>
being forced with the stream to the bottom of the liquor,
passes through it in a number of fine streams.</p>

<p>If the amount of sulphide present be very high it may be
necessary to prolong the oxidising operation beyond the time
necessary for complete causticising.</p>

<p>In many paper-mills the causticising is conducted in circular
vessels furnished with mechanical agitators. These are more
expensive than the simple form described above, and they
possess no special advantages. The use of causticisers in which
neither mechanical agitation nor agitation by means of air is
provided for is exceedingly wasteful of labour, time, steam, and
soda. The lime-mud settles at the bottom as a hard mass, very
difficult to manipulate.</p>

CHAPTER XIII.
<span class="hsmall">
PAPER TESTING.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">There are two points of view from which a paper may be
tested: first, of physical or mechanical properties; secondly,
of material composition. We shall consider the subject
according to this division.</p>

<p>(I.) Quantitative measurements of such properties as resistances
to breaking and tearing strains are seldom made by
English paper-makers. In Germany, on the other hand, the
matter has been very thoroughly investigated in connection
with the work of the Königl. Techn. Versuchsanstalt, Berlin,
and through the agency and influence of Prof. Sell, and
C. Hofmann, a department has been organised exclusively for
the work of paper testing. The results of the tests are
becoming widely recognised by practical men and the trade
in that country, as affording a true index of the quality of a
paper. It is therefore of importance to give an outline of
the methods employed.</p>

<p>The determination of the strain or weight which a paper
is capable of supporting is a very obvious measure of the
strength of the paper. Observations of the limiting strain
or breaking weight are sometimes made by paper-makers,
but the apparatus and method employed are usually crude.
The simplest means consist in clamping the paper—a strip
of standard length and breadth, arbitrarily chosen—at one
end, the clamp being firmly held in a fixed support, and to
the other attaching by means of a similar clamp, an ordinary
scale pan, the whole arrangement hanging vertically. Into
the pan, weights are added in due succession until fracture
of the strip is determined. It is scarcely
necessary to point <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span>
out that the errors of experiment with such a method
are very great: indeed it has been found that even with the
refined apparatus about to be described the errors are not
inconsiderable. However, by exhaustive investigation,
according to the well-known “law of errors,” these have
been quantified, and a careful operator can therefore obtain
results which are trustworthy. The apparatus in question
is the Hartig-Reusch machine.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn14" id="fnanc14">14</a>
It is shown in sectional
elevation and plan in Figs. 75 and 76.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc14" id="fn14">14</a>
A complete de­scrip­tion of this machine is given in ‘Civil Engineer,’
1879.</p></div>

<p>The principle will be readily grasped by inspection of the
diagrammatic representation of its essential parts—Fig. 77.
The strip of paper is held horizontally by the clamps <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,
<i>a</i> being held by the fixed support A, <i>b</i> by the movable
carriage B. B is connected by means of a swivel with the
spiral spring F, and this again is similarly connected with
the screw, which is made to rotate by the wheel D. By
turning D, therefore, the spiral may be extended, and a
corresponding strain communicated through B and <i>b</i> to the
paper. The paper undergoes a certain elongation under the
strain, and the carriage B moves from right to left in consequence.
The rotation of the screw is continued, and the
extension of the spiral proceeds until the paper is fractured.
At this point it is required to determine, (1) the elongation
of the spiral which is the measure of the breaking strain,
and (2) the distance through which the carriage has moved,
i.e. the elongation of the paper. Both these effects are communicated
to the pencil G, the latter directly, since the
pencil-holder is in rigid connection with B, the former
through the rod I, from which, by a special arrangement,
the horizontal is converted into a vertical motion of the
pencil. This, therefore, traces a curve, of which the ordinates
represent the strains, and the abscissæ the elongations
of the paper produced by the strain.</p>

<p>The scale shown in Fig. 76 indicates the exact position of
the clamp A. <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span></p>

<div class="dctr03">

</div></div></div><!--dctr03-->

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span></div>

<p>The values for the spiral spring—i.e. extension for a
given load—having been determined by previous observations
in a special apparatus, the curve obtained is at once a
measure and a permanent record of these cardinal factors,
breaking strain and elasticity. As with all other such
instruments, the recording apparatus introduces certain
errors, which, however, by careful investigation and modification
in accordance with the results, have been reduced to
a minimum. Nevertheless, the director, Dr. Martens, has
recently adopted a simpler instrument, altogether similar in
principle, but based upon a direct reading of the two movements,
in which of course these errors do not appear. For
the student, however, the recording instrument is the more
instructive, and we have given it preference for de­scrip­tion
here, more especially as no difference in essential parts is
involved.</p>

<p>Those who wish to pursue the matter into the most
interesting details of the investigations made upon the subject,
are referred to the papers published by the Institute
for 1885.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn15" id="fnanc15">15</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc15" id="fn15">15</a>
Mittheilungen a. d. Königl. Techn. Versuchsanst, Berlin.</p></div>

<p>In testing the strength of papers by this or similar
machines, it is important to observe the hygrometric state of
the atmosphere at the time the trials are made, as this has
been found to exert a considerable influence on the results,
a paper being weaker the moister the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The results of the tests are expressed in the following
terms:—The elongation is given directly in percentage of
the original length. This is uniformly taken at 180 mm.,
a length arrived at after laborious investigation, as minimising
the errors of experiment; in other words, as giving
mean value with the minimum of variation. For the
breaking strain an ingenious expression has been arrived at,
viz. the length of the paper which suspended vertically,
with one end hanging freely, the other fixed, would
determine fracture at the fixed end. As the breaking strain
would vary with the thickness, the
numbers obtained in <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span>
units of force or weight for strips of constant breadth, would
need correction in order to admit of strict comparison with
one another. By substituting an expression in terms of the
paper itself—since a paper of greater thickness, and requiring
therefore a proportionately greater force to fracture it,
weighs more per unit of area, and in the same proportion—all
the numbers for breaking strains are strictly comparative
one with the other. In the same way also the question of
width may be disregarded.</p>

<p>A further mechanical test, forming a part of the scheme
of investigation, is the resistance of the paper to rubbing.
This test is an altogether empirical one, as the following
brief de­scrip­tion will show:—A piece of the paper, about
6 inches square, crumpled by successive folding in two
directions at right angles, is grasped by the thumb and forefinger
of each hand, at a distance of 3–4 inches apart. It is
then rubbed upon itself across the thumbs a given number
of times (seven is the number chosen) and held up to the
light. If no holes are visible, the rubbing is repeated. The
number of times necessary to repeat the rubbing until holes
appear is the measure of the resistance. A sufficient uniformity
in the results of this test has been observed to make
it the basis of a classification of papers, in regard to their
resistance to such disintegration; they are divided into the
following eight groups, beginning with the <span class="nowrap">lowest:—</span></p>

<div class="dtablebox">
<ul id="ulp197">
<li>0. Extremely weak.</li>

<li>6. Very strong.</li>
<li>7. Extremely strong.</li></ul>

<p>The classification of papers on the results of these tests
cannot be more lucidly given than in the following scheme,

<p>This classification is based on the results of some hundreds
of observations. It is interesting to note the differences
observed in the numbers for <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> according to the
direction for the test in which the paper is cut, i.e. in the
direction in which it was run on the paper machine, or at right
angles (see Chap. XI. p. <a href="#p171" title="go to p. 171">171</a>). The mean ratio for the breaking
lengths (strains) may be taken as <span class="nowrap">
1&#x202f;:&#x202f;1·6,</span> i.e.
the paper is about 40 per cent.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn16"
id="fnanc16">16</a> weaker across the web; the elongation under
strain on the other hand is about double.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc16" id="fn16">16</a>
In the statement of results the mean of the numbers obtained in the
two directions is given.</p></div>

<p>It is also of interest to note the influence of the glazing
process (p. <a href="#p167" title="go to p. 167">167</a>) upon the quality of the paper as determined
by these tests.</p>

<p>First, we must notice the effect of the treatment upon the
substance of the paper itself. The mean reduction of thickness
is 23 per cent. On the other hand, the reduction of
weight, calculated per unit of surface (square metre), is
6·7 per cent., whence we may infer an increase of surface,
flattening out, in the process. These quantities, but more
particularly the latter, will doubtless vary with the various
methods of glazing and with the materials of which the
paper is composed.</p>

<p>The breaking length (strain) shows a mean increase of
about 8 per cent.; the elongation under strain, on the other
hand, a diminution of 6 per cent.</p>

<p>For an interesting discussion of the question of the relative
strengths of machine and hand-made paper see ‘Paper,’ by
Richard Parkinson.</p>

<p>The thickness of a paper may be determined by means of
an ordinary micrometer, such as is shown in Fig. 78. The
paper is placed in the jaws of the instrument,
and the screw <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span>
advanced until it touches the paper. The thickness is then
read off on the scale. Other forms of apparatus are sold for
the same purpose. In making a determination of the thickness
of a paper it is necessary to take the mean of a series of
observations at different points of the sheet, as the thickness
may vary somewhat.</p>

<h3 class="h3cntr"><i>Determination of Composition of Papers.</i></h3>

<p>(II.) The analysis of a paper naturally divides itself into two
parts:—(<i>a</i>) The determination of the nature of the fibrous
material of which it is composed; and (<i>b</i>) the identification
of such adventitious substances as size and filling material.</p>

<div class="dhn">(<h4 class="h4inlineit" title="a. microscopical
analysis">a</h4>) This again is divided into two sets of
observations—microscopical and chemical.</div>

<p>A fragment of the paper is soaked for some time in glycerine,
and is then carefully teased out with a pair of needles, and
the fragments laid on a glass slip with a drop of glycerine.
A cover-glass is then laid on and lightly pressed down so as
to spread the fibres in a thin layer.</p>

<p>The microscopical features of the different fibres have been
already described, and it is only necessary now to summarise
the chief characteristics of the more important materials.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineit">Cotton.</h5>—Flat
riband-like fibres, frequently twisted upon
themselves. The ends generally appear laminated. The
fibres are frequently covered with numerous fine markings
(see Frontispiece).</div>

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineit">Linen.</h5>—Cylindrical
fibres, similar to the typical bast fibre
(see Fig. 6). The ends are frequently drawn out into
numerous fibrillæ (see Frontispiece).</div>

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineit">Esparto.</h5>—Esparto
pulp consists of a complex of bast fibres
and epidermal cells. These serrated cells are, as has been
already pointed out, characteristic of esparto, straw, and
similar fibres. Certain differences exist between those of
esparto and straw, and even between the different species of
straw, which enable the microscopist to identify their source.
The most characteristic feature of esparto pulp
is the presence <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span>
of a number of the fine hairs which line the inner surface of
the leaf (<i>e</i>, Fig. 10), some of which invariably survive the
boiling and washing processes, although the greater portion
passes away through the wire-cloth of the washing engines.
The presence of these hairs may be taken as conclusive
evidence of the presence of esparto.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineit">Straw.</h5>—Straw
pulp very closely resembles esparto-pulp in
its microscopical features. The hairs above alluded to are,
however, absent. On the other hand, a number of flat oval
cells are always present in paper made from straw (<i>b</i>, Fig. 13).
It should be borne in mind, however, that bamboo and similar
pulps also contain these cells.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineit">Wood (Chemical).</h5>—Flat
riband-like fibres, showing unbroken
ends (see photographs, Frontispiece). The presence
of the pitted vessels (Frontispiece, and <i>a</i>, Fig. 15) is eminently
characteristic of pulp prepared from pine-wood. The fibres
of other woods are not sufficiently characteristic. They much
resemble those of pine-wood, with this difference, that the
pitted vessels are absent.</div>

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineit">Wood (Mechanical).</h5>—Mechanical
wood-pulp may be recognised
by the peculiar configuration of the torn ends of the
fibres, and from the fact that the fibres are rarely separated,
but are generally more or less agglomerated (see Frontispiece).
Pulp from pine of course shows the pitted vessels already
referred to. They are usually more distinct than in chemical
wood-pulp. Occasionally fragments are to be met with connected
together with portions of the medullary rays.</div>

<p>The microscopical examination of a paper is a matter of
very great difficulty, and one requiring much practice. The
student is recommended to study closely for himself the
microscopical features of pulps obtained from authentic specimens.</p>

<p>Some approximate idea of the relative proportion of the
various fibres present in a paper can be obtained from a
careful microscopical examination.</p>

<p>Vétillart maintains that a quantitative determination within
a fair limit of accuracy is possible. On the
other hand, the <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span>
Berlin Prüfungsanstalt do not profess to do more than merely
identify the fibres.</p>

<p>In examining a paper under the microscope, it should be
observed whether the fibres appear as fragments, or whether
they consist of whole bast cells in which the tapered ends
appear.</p>

<p>Cotton and linen, owing to the great length of their ultimate
fibres, yield, when beaten, fragments showing where
the fracture has taken place. From the appearance of this
fracture it is possible to ascertain whether or not the beating
operation has been properly conducted. If the beater-knives
have been too sharp, or have been let down to the bed-plate
too quickly, the fractures will appear as clean cuts, whereas
when the operation has been properly conducted the fracture
will appear ragged and drawn out. The bearing of this on
the strength of the finished paper is considerable.</p>

<p>Esparto, straw, and wood, whose ultimate fibres do not exceed
1–2 mm., should, in the majority of cases, appear as whole
bast fibres with two tapered ends; the beating, when properly
conducted, being confined merely to the separation into these
ultimate fibres.</p>

<div class="dhn">(<h4 class="h4inlineit" title="b. chemical
analysis">b</h4>) For the chemical identification of the fibres
in a paper, the only available reactions are those with aniline
sulphate solution. The majority of fibres (celluloses) give no
reaction, straw and esparto celluloses and mechanical wood-pulp
being the only ones that can be identified by its means. The
authors have found that when a paper containing straw or esparto
is treated for some time with a boiling 1 per cent. solution
of aniline sulphate, a pink colour is produced. Esparto gives
the reaction with greater intensity than straw. In this way the
presence of a very small quantity of these pulps can be detected
with certainty.</div>

<p>Mechanical wood-pulp, when treated with a solution of
aniline sulphate, develops, even in the cold, a deep yellow
colour. If a paper containing mechanical wood-pulp so
treated be examined under the microscope, the fragments of
wood will be found to be deeply stained,
whereas the other <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
fibres remain colourless or nearly so. It must be borne in
mind that cellulose obtained from lignified fibres, if the boiling
and bleaching processes have not been carried sufficiently
far, will give with aniline sulphate a more or less intense
yellow coloration. Various other reagents have been suggested
for the identification of mechanical wood-pulp, all
based upon the production of a colour with lignose.</p>

<p>The reaction of lignose with chlorine and sodium sulphite
solution already referred to (p. <a href="#p019" title="go to p. 19">19</a>) may also be made available
for the detection of mechanical wood-pulp in a paper.
Imperfectly boiled or bleached pulps sometimes give this
reaction faintly.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineit">Quantitative Estimation
of Mechanical Wood-pulp.</h5>—The
determination of the amount of mechanical wood-pulp present
in a paper is sometimes a matter of some importance, and it
is also a matter of great difficulty. Some idea of the amount
present can be obtained by observing the depth of the yellow
colour produced with aniline sulphate or the intensity of the
magenta reaction with chlorine and sodium sulphite. It is
also possible to calculate approximately the percentage from
the percentage of cellulose contained in the specimen. Mechanical
wood-pulp (pine) may be taken to contain 60 per
cent. of cellulose. If, therefore, a paper ascertained to contain
a pure cellulose in addition to this constituent, yield
75 per cent. of cellulose on the ordinary test, it may be
assumed that about 62·5 per cent. of mechanical wood-pulp
is present.</div>

<p>The authors have proposed a method of estimating the
amount of mechanical wood-pulp present in a paper, based
upon the absorption of iodine in definite proportions by wood
in a finely divided state, under strictly regulated conditions.
The paper is carefully reduced to a fine pulp, and is then
left in contact with a standard solution of iodine in potassium
iodide. At the end of twenty-four hours the amount of free
iodine is determined by titration with sodium thiosulphate
and by deducting this from the amount originally taken, the
amount absorbed is ascertained. As
this amount, under <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
strictly comparative conditions, always corresponds to a
definite amount of mechanical wood-pulp the amount present
can be readily calculated.</p>

<div class="dhn">2. <h5 class="h5inlineit">Loading, Sizing
Materials, &#x26;c.</h5>—The determination of the amount
of loading material in a paper has been already described
(p. <a href="#p134" title="go to p. 134">134</a>). The identification of the material can only be
arrived at by a careful chemical analysis. The principal
loading materials are china-clay and pearl-hardening (calcium
sulphate). The ash from a paper containing china-clay is
insoluble in boiling dilute hydrochloric acid; that from
paper containing calcium sulphate is soluble: the solution
on cooling deposits long needle-shaped crystals of <span
class="nowrap">CaSO<sub>4</sub>&#x2005;2&#x200a;H<sub>2</sub>O</span>
and gives with barium chloride a copious precipitate of
BaSO<sub>4</sub> (barium sulphate) insoluble in acids, and
with ammonia and oxalate of ammonia a precipitate of calcium
oxalate.</div>

<p>The presence of starch in a paper can be readily ascertained
by its behaviour with a solution of iodine. If starch be
present the well-known blue colour of the compound of
iodine and starch will be produced. The determination
of the amount of starch present is a matter of some difficulty,
the details of which are somewhat beyond the scope of the
present work. It is based upon the conversion of the starch
into sugar, and the estimation of the latter with Fehling’s
solution.</p>

<p>The nature of the material with which a paper is sized
may be ascertained in the following <span class="nowrap">way:—</span></p>

<p>The sample, cut up into small fragments, is warmed for a
few minutes with alcohol containing a few drops of acetic
acid. The alcohol is allowed to cool, and is then poured into
four or five times its bulk of distilled water. If any precipitate
or cloudiness is produced, it indicates that the paper
has been sized with rosin. The alcohol dissolves the rosin,
which, being insoluble in water, is thrown down on dilution.
The alcohol used should be previously purified by distillation,
as some samples contain a small quantity of shellac, which
would itself be
precipitated with water. <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span></p>

<p>The paper after treatment with alcohol should now be
boiled for some minutes with water: the solution allowed to
cool, and then filtered. To the filtrate a few drops of a
solution of tannic acid are added, when, if the paper has
been sized with gelatine, a white curdy precipitate will be
formed.</p>

<p>The estimation of the amount of sizing material in a paper
is a very complicated process and one which demands considerable
chemical experience for its proper conduct.</p>

<p>The amount of gelatine present is best ascertained by
determining the amount of nitrogen present by combustion
with soda-lime, and from this, calculating the amount of
gelatine. Pure gelatine contains 18·16 per cent. of nitrogen
(Muntz). The comparison of one paper with another with a
view to ascertain the relative degree of sizing, is usually
performed in a more or less rough and ready way by moistening
the samples with the tongue for a certain time, and
noticing the degree of transparency produced, which is of
course inversely to the degree of hardness. A more accurate
method consists in placing a drop of a mixture of alcohol
and water containing some colouring matter in solution and
determining the time necessary for the colour to make its
appearance on the other side. In this way more trustworthy
comparisons can be made.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h5 class="h5inlineit">Colouring

<h2 class="h2herein" title="Chapter XIV."> CHAPTER XIV.
<span class="hsmall">GENERAL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS FOR
PAPER-MAKERS.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">A knowledge of the methods usually employed for the
qualitative and quantitative analysis of the various chemical
substances met with in paper manufacture is of considerable
importance. The scope of this work will not allow
us to enter fully into the necessary details of manipulation;
for these the reader is referred to standard works on
analysis; we will merely indicate the methods.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Caustic Soda, Soda
Ash, Recovered Soda, &#x26;c.</h3>—These substances are always
valued by the amount of real alkali (Na<sub>2</sub>O) that
they contain, which is determined by titration with a standard
acid.</div>

<p>In testing recovered soda, it is necessary to <i>boil</i> the finely
powdered ash for some time with water; unless this be done,
the amount of alkali will probably be under-estimated, as
part of the soda is present as a difficultly soluble silicate.</p>

<p>It is sometimes desirable to determine the amount both of
sodium hydrate and carbonate in a sample of alkali. For
this purpose an excess of a solution of barium chloride is
added to a solution containing a known quantity of the
substance under examination, and the mixture made up to a
definite volume. It is then filtered, and an aliquot portion
of the filtrate titrated with standard alkali. The filtrate contains
only the alkali that was originally present as hydrate,
the carbonate of soda having formed with the barium
chloride, insoluble barium carbonate, and sodium chloride.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Bleaching
Powder.</h3>—The value of bleaching powder <span class="xxpn"
id="p206">{206}</span> depends upon the amount of available
chlorine that it contains. This is determined by means
of a standard solution of arsenious acid. The standard
solution is prepared by dissolving pure arsenious oxide
(As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in sodium carbonate solution.
To test the powder, a quantity, say about 5 grms., is taken,
and is carefully ground up in a mortar with a small quantity
of water, more water is then added, and the coarser particles
allowed to settle for a few seconds. The milky liquid is then
run off into a graduated flask; the residue is again ground up
with water, and the operations repeated until the whole of the
powder is transferred to the flask. The flask is now filled up
to the proper mark, carefully shaken, and an aliquot portion
withdrawn as quickly as possible. It is necessary to take both
the soluble and insoluble portions in order to obtain uniform
results. Standard arsenious acid solution is now run in until
the solution ceases to produce a blue colour with iodide of
potassium and starch papers.</div>

<p>The method of estimating the amount of available chlorine
in bleaching powder by determining the quantity of ferrous
sulphate it is capable of oxidising is fallacious, as by this
means calcium chlorate is included in the result.</p>

<p>Bleaching powder should contain about 35 per cent. of
available chlorine, but the percentage frequently falls below
this amount, especially in warm weather.</p>

<p>Great care should be exercised in the sampling of bleaching
powder, as indeed of all chemicals, in order to insure an
average result. Small portions should be taken from
different parts of the bulk; the whole should then be carefully
mixed, and, if necessary, reduced to powder. Portions
of the mixture should be taken, pounded, and again
thoroughly mixed.</p>

<p>If this process be repeated once or twice, a perfectly
uniform sample will be obtained.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Alum, Sulphate of
Alumina, Alum Cake, &#x26;c.</h3>—The points to be considered
in an examination of these products are (1) the percentage
of alumina contained in them; (2) the <span class="xxpn"
id="p207">{207}</span> percentage of iron, and (3) the amount of
free sulphuric acid present.</div>
<ul><li>
<p>(1) The alumina is estimated as such by precipitation
with ammonia. Ferric oxide is also thrown down with
alumina, and must therefore be deducted from the amount of
the mixed oxides obtained.</p></li>

<li><p>(2) The percentage of iron oxide present is determined in
the following way. A considerable quantity of the sample
under examination is dissolved in water, and to the boiling
solution a large excess of caustic potash solution is added.
The caustic potash precipitates both the alumina and ferric
hydrates, the former, however, redissolves. The solution is
filtered, and the precipitate of ferric hydrate washed,
dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, and reprecipitated with
excess of caustic potash. It is again thrown on to a filter,
washed, redissolved in hydrochloric acid, and again reprecipitated
with ammonia. In this way it is obtained free
from alumina.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn17" id="fnanc17">17</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc17" id="fn17">17</a>
For a method of estimating minute quantities of iron in alums see
‘Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind.,’ April 1887, p. 276.</p></div></li>

<li><p>(3) <i>Free Acid.</i>—This can be estimated indirectly, i.e. by
estimating the alumina and ferric oxide, calculating the
amount of sulphuric acid necessary to combine with them,
and deducting this from the total amount of sulphuric acid
obtained. In the case of alum it is of course necessary to
make due allowance for the sulphate of potash or ammonia
present. The sulphuric acid is estimated as barium sulphate
in the usual way.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that sulphates of alumina are
sometimes met with containing uncombined alumina. A
convenient method of estimating free acid consists in digesting
a weighed quantity of the finely powdered sample in
strong alcohol. The alcohol dissolves away the free acid,
which can be estimated in the solution by means of a standard
solution of alkali.</p>

<p>Free acid can be detected by means of a solution of <span class="xxpn" id="p208">{208}</span>
Congo-red, which is turned blue with free acid, but not with pure
sulphate of alumina.</p></li></ul>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Antichlor,
Sodium Thiosulphate, Sodium Sulphite, &#x26;c.</h3>—Sodium
thiosulphate can be estimated by means of a standard solution
of iodine in potassium iodide. The operation should be
performed in dilute solution (see p. <a href="#p111" title="go to p. 111">111</a>).</div>

<p>The same solution serves also for the estimation of sulphurous
acid in sodium and other sulphites.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Starches.</h3>—After
having made a careful microscopical examination
of the sample, it should be examined for water by
drying at 100°C., and for mineral matter by igniting in a
platinum crucible and weighing the residue. The water
should not exceed 18 per cent., and the ash ·50 per cent.
The samples should be carefully examined for insoluble matter
by dissolving in water and filtering. It is also useful in
comparing different samples of starch to convert the
specimens into pastes, under exactly similar conditions.</div>

<p>When perfectly cold, the “stiffness” of the pastes should
be compared. This may be done by noting the relative
resistance to weights placed upon their surface. Information
on this subject is contained in a paper by W. Thomson in
the ‘Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind.,’ March 1886.</p>

<p>The identification of starches by means of their microscopical
appearances is tolerably simple, as each particular kind
possesses characteristic differences.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Gelatine.</h3>—Samples
of gelatine should be examined for
water and ash. The water should not exceed 16 per cent.
and the ash 2·7 per cent. The relative strengths of the
jellies formed with water should also be compared. This
may be done in the way indicated above for starches.</div>

<p>Raw materials intended for the preparation of gelatine
may be similarly examined. They yield the whole of their
gelatine on heating with water. The effect of prolonged
heating on solution of gelatine should be borne in mind.
The amount of residue left after treatment with water should
be carefully determined.</p>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Soaps.</h3>—The
soaps most suitable for
use in paper-making <span class="xxpn" id="p209">{209}</span>
are those known as curd and mottled, the former being
chiefly used for the fine qualities. They should be carefully
examined for free alkali and unsaponified fat. Full de­scrip­tions
are contained in Lant Carpenter’s ‘Treatise on Soap-making.’</div>

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Dyes, Pigments, Loading
Materials, &#x26;c.</h3>—These substances are best examined from
a physical and tinctorial point of view, by comparison with
specimens of undoubted purity and excellence.</div>

<p>The chemical examination is both difficult and somewhat
misleading. A microscopical examination will often throw
much light on their composition.</p>

<p>For comparing the tinctorial power of different samples,
weighed quantities should be ground up with starch or some other
white powder. In this way some idea of the intensity of colour
can be readily arrived at.</p>

<h2 class="h2herein" title="Chapter XV.">CHAPTER XV.<span
 class="hsmall">SITE FOR PAPER-MILL, WATER-SUPPLY, WATER
 PURIFICATION, ETC.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">In choosing a spot on which to build a paper-mill, the
manufacturer has to take into consideration several very
important circumstances. Chief of these is the necessity for
having a large supply of water at command. Not only is a
large quantity needful, but it should be free from impurities,
such as suspended matter and iron. The former, it is true,
can be removed by settling and filtration; the latter cannot,
and is liable to injuriously affect the colour of the paper.
Again, as a question of economy in working, it is advantageous
to have convenient water-power; therefore for this, as well
as for the former reason, paper-mills are usually situated on
the bank of a stream. In choosing such a site, paper-makers
are probably also influenced by the fact that it affords a ready
means for the removal of impurities. In properly conducted
mills, where suitable apparatus is employed for evaporating
the liquors in which the raw material has been boiled, the
stream should not be polluted to any very great extent.
Generally speaking, the greater the pollution, the more are
valuable materials being lost to the manufacturer. It is
obvious that the site for a mill should also be chosen with
reference to its proximity to means of transit for the raw and
manufactured materials.</p>

<p>The disposition of the different divisions of a paper-mill
depends of course upon the nature of the paper it is intended
to make and to a large extent upon local circumstances.
Fig. 79 will give some idea of the general arrangement of
a mill for manufacturing esparto paper. <span class="xxpn"

<div class="dhn"><h3 class="h3inlineit">Water
Pur­i­fi­ca­tion.</h3>—Arnot in his Can­tor Lec­tures on the
Tech­nol­o­gy of the Paper Trade states that from 30,000 to 40,000
gallons of water are required for the manufacture of each ton of
paper. The importance of a pure and copious supply is therefore
very evident.</div>

<p>The impurities of water consist of two classes, insoluble
and soluble. The former can be readily removed by processes
of settling and filtration. For this purpose most paper-mills
are provided with large ponds capable of holding several days’
supply. These are sometimes supplemented by filtering beds.
Insoluble impurities can also be removed by passing the water
through filter-presses.</p>

<p>Fig. 80 is an illustration of Rœckner’s patent clarifier,
which may also be applied to this purpose.</p>

<p>The cylinders C dip below the surface of the water to be
purified, which is contained in the reservoir A. They are open
at their lower ends, but are closed at the top by the domes D.
These are connected with the pump I by means of the pipes H.
On starting the pump the water rises slowly in the cylinders.
As soon as it reaches the level of the top, the action of the
pump is stopped and the cocks K opened, when the water commences
to flow down the pipes G, which together <span class="xxpn"
id="p212">{212}</span> with the cylinders form a kind of
siphon. If the reservoir A be kept full, the siphons can be made
to act continuously. The flow of water being slow, insoluble
impurities have time to subside.</p>

<p>The impurities may from time to time be removed by means of
the small pump L connected with the bottom of the reservoir.</p>

<p>The clarifier can also be used for the purification of the
effluent water from paper-mills.</p>

<div class="dcaption"><span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span>

<p>Insoluble impurities can be removed from water by means
of the Stanhope purifier, shown in Fig. 81.</p>

<p>The soluble impurities of water consist mainly of carbonate
and sulphate of calcium and iron, and occasionally
organic matter. It is a moot
point among paper-makers <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span>
whether or not the presence of the two former in a water is
objectionable. For boiling and bleaching purposes it
undoubtedly is, as when mixed with caustic soda or bleaching
liquor they form a precipitate of carbonate of calcium,
which lines the insides of boilers, breakers, and potchers as
a hard scale, which is always liable to become detached, and
to find its way into the finished paper. Moreover, carbonate
of calcium is precipitated in the fibre, and carries with it a
certain quantity of colouring matter, the subsequent removal
of which is difficult.</p>

<p>Carbonate of calcium, though practically insoluble in pure
water, is soluble in water containing carbonic acid. When
this carbonic acid is neutralised by lime or soda, the carbonate
is precipitated. The sulphate of calcium is unacted upon
by lime, but by the action of caustic soda is converted into
free lime and sodium sulphate. The lime then neutralises
the free carbonic acid in the water, and forms carbonate of
calcium, which is of course precipitated.</p>

<p>These reactions may be represented by the following

<p>It will be seen from the above equation that in the boiling
processes the lime salts are removed from the water at the expense
of an equivalent quantity of caustic soda. The amount
thus decomposed is not sufficiently large to
make it advisable <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
on that account to purify the water. It is indeed so small
that processes of purification, based upon the use of lime and
caustic soda, are now largely used, the cost for chemicals
rarely exceeding 1<i>d.</i> per 1000 gallons. But for the reasons
we have stated above, and also from the fact that it serves
to remove dissolved iron and organic matter from a water,
such a purification process is in certain cases advisable.</p>

<p>The processes now in use consist, as we have indicated, in
the addition to the water of lime and caustic soda or carbonate
of soda, the quantities being regulated according to the
hardness of the water, and the relative proportions of
carbonate and sulphate of calcium.</p>

<p>The method of removing carbonate of calcium from water
by the addition of lime is due to the late Dr. Clark, of
Aberdeen, and the process is still called after him. It is in
use in its original form in many places. The plant necessary
consists simply of a tank for mixing the water and the lime,
and of large settling tanks in which the carbonate of calcium
subsides.</p>

<p>Various modifications of this process have been proposed,
chiefly in the direction of improved plant.</p>

<p>In the Porter-Clark process the carbonate of calcium is
removed by passing the water after the addition of lime (in
the form of lime-water) through a filter-press.</p>

<p>In Fig. 81 is shown the Stanhope purifier, which is largely
used for the purpose of softening water. The following
details will render its action clear: A is a store tank containing
caustic soda solution. B is a tank into which the
water to be treated flows, and which is maintained at a
constant level by means of a valve and float. C and C are
two tanks which are used alternately, and in which lime
water is prepared. A definite quantity of caustic soda
solution is added from B; this mixture forms the reagent by
which the softening of the water is ac­com­plished. D is a
small tank for the purpose of maintaining a constant head
of reagent. The reagent and the water are mixed together
in the pipe F, the quantities being regulated
by the cocks <span class="xxpn" id="p216">{216}</span>
shown at H. The pipe F leads into the vessel E, which is
fitted with a number of <span class="nowrap">
<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u1d5b5-v.png" width="48" height="80"
alt="V" />-shaped</span>
shelves, placed at an angle
of 45°, and riveted alternately to opposite sides of the vessel.
This arrangement causes the water to take a serpentine
course. The position of the shelves is indicated by the
dotted lines.</p>

<p>As soon as the mixture of water and reagent flows down
the pipe F, and enters the vessel E, the calcium carbonate
commences to precipitate and settles upon the <span class="nowrap">
<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u1d5b5-v.png" width="48" height="80"
alt="V" />-shaped</span>
shelves. At the top of the tank a layer of wood shavings,
inclosed in wire-netting, is placed as shown by the dotted
lines. This acts as a filter, and intercepts any particles that
may not have subsided. The clear purified water passes
away by the pipe I.</p>

<p>The precipitate that collects on the <span class="nowrap">
<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u1d5b5-v.png" width="48" height="80"
alt="V" />-shaped</span> plates is
from time to time drawn off by the cocks shown at G; this
may be done without interfering with the working of the
apparatus. While there can be no doubt that the use of
soft water is advantageous in the boiling, washing, and
bleaching processes, and also of course for supplying steam
boilers, it is probably an advantage to use a hard water for
diluting the pulp before running it into the machine.</p>

<p>In the case of papers which are loaded with any of the
forms of calcium sulphate (pearl-hardening, crystal-hardening,
&#x26;c.) the use of very soft water is objectionable from the
fact that a certain quantity of calcium sulphate is dissolved.
This would not take place to the same extent with water
which is already charged with sulphate and carbonate of
calcium.</p>

<p>The removal of soluble iron from a water is effected by the
softening processes described.</p>

CHAPTER XVI.
<span class="hsmall">
ACTION OF CUPRAMMONIUM ON CELLULOSE.
PREPARATION OF WILLESDEN PAPER.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">The
action of a solution of copper oxide in ammonia upon
cellulose has been already referred to (see p. <a href="#p005" title="go to p. 5">5</a>). Celluloses,
and also lignocelluloses, when treated with such a solution,
gradually gelatinise and finally dissolve. On evaporating
the solution to dryness, a gummy amorphous mass is
obtained, containing the cellulose intermixed with copper
oxide.</p>

<p>If the cellulose be in excess, e.g. when the solution is
evaporated on the surface of paper, calico, &#x26;c., merely dipped
in the solution, the copper oxide is often not formed at all,
but a green varnish-like mass of cellulose combined with
copper oxide, which coats the surface of each filament, welding
and cementing them together. This cement-like <i>cupro-cellulose</i>,
as it may be termed, being insoluble in water,
communicates water-resisting properties to the material so
treated: moreover, the presence of copper renders the fabric
less prone than before to be attacked by insects and mould,
so that animal and vegetable life of a parasitic nature and
fungoid growths are rarely, if ever, to be observed, even
when the material is kept under conditions where boring
worms, ants, rot, and mould, would be likely to attack it.</p>

<p>As has been already indicated (p. <a href="#p005" title="go to p. 5">5</a>), the solution of
cu­pram­mon­ium hy­drox­ide is preferable to one containing
cu­pram­mon­ium salts; not only is the action on cellulose
more energetic, but various other advantages are obtained.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of the Copper Solution.</i>—The cu­pram­mon­ium
solution is prepared according to the patent of Dr. C.
R. Alder Wright (No. 737, 1883). <span class="xxpn"
id="p218">{218}</span></p>

<p>A series of cast-iron towers, two to three feet in diameter
and ten to twelve feet high, is so arranged that a current
of air can be blown by a powerful engine successively
through the whole series. The towers are then nearly filled
with fragments of metallic copper (crumbled up sheet, cuttings,
&#x26;c.), and solution of ammonia: the air-current being
turned on, oxidation of the copper and solution of the oxide
so produced are rapidly effected.</p>

<p>The ammonia solution employed is previously impregnated
with a considerable quantity of copper by passing a stream
of water over scrap copper in similar towers, a current of
ammonia gas mixed with a suitable proportion of air being
at the same time forced in. The liquor passing from one
tower is used over again to supply a second instead of water,
and so on through the series: finally the liquor is brought
up to full copper strength in the series of towers described
above.</p>

<p>The spent air issuing from the towers carries with it a
notable quantity of ammonia; this is intercepted by means
of an “exhaust” scrubber containing copper, and well supplied
with water, whereby a comparatively weak solution of
ammonia and copper is obtained, which can be used instead
of water in the first series of towers.</p>

<p>In order to produce the maximum effect on the cellulose,
the solution should contain from 100 to 150 lbs. of ammonia,
and from 20 to 25 lbs. of copper per 100 gallons.</p>

<p>By decomposing a cu­pram­mon­ium solution by means of
metallic zinc, a corresponding solution of zinc-ammonium
hydroxide can be obtained. This solution is also capable of
gelatinising cellulose, but not to the same extent as the
copper solution. It may, however, be advantageously employed
in certain cases in conjunction with a copper solution.
Such a solution can be conveniently prepared by substituting
brass for copper in the dissolving-towers. It is worthy of
note that although, as we have seen, zinc has the power of
replacing copper in a cu­pram­mon­ium solution, iron is without
any action, although it readily replaces copper
in a solution <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span>
of copper sulphate. This fact is of very great industrial
importance, as it enables the manufacturer to employ vessels
and machinery of iron.</p>

<p>The “Willesden” goods may be divided into two classes.
Goods of the first class, such as rope, cordage, netting, &#x26;c.,
are prepared by simply dipping the made-up materials in a
bath of cu­pram­mon­ium solution, using certain precautions
as to the mode of immersion and its duration, and the
strength of the solution. On subsequently drying the dipped
fabrics, they are obtained coated and impregnated with
cupro-cellulose, which thus not only forms a kind of
varnish-like surface dressing, but further adds strength
to the fibres by more or less intimately cementing them
together.</p>

<p>Goods of the second class constitute a much more important
group to which at present the Willesden Company more
especially devotes its attention. These fabrics are essentially
of three kinds, viz. Willesden Canvas, Willesden Scrim, and
Willesden Paper. The two former of these classes are prepared
in much the same way as the goods just described,
saving that the fabric to be treated is usually unwound from
one roller and rewound upon another, after passing through
the bath and over a succession of drying cylinders.</p>

<p><i>Willesden Paper.</i>—This
may be divided into two departments,
viz. (1) Willesden unwelded; (2) Willesden welded,
the first class being prepared from a single web of paper by
passing it through the bath, rolling and drying. Certain
coarse varieties furnish a waterproof material excellently
adapted for lining packages, &#x26;c. Finer qualities furnish
envelopes and stationery, possessing the valuable property of
not being affected by water. Letters written on such paper
would remain perfectly legible, even after prolonged immersion.
It may be interesting to point out here that the
cu­pram­mon­ium solution offers a very simple means of fastening
envelopes in such a way as to be proof against any
attempts at tampering. The method consists in using a
concentrated solution as the fastening
material; the envelope <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span>
is then closed and ironed with a warm flat-iron, whereby the
gelatinised cellulose is converted into an insoluble cupro-cellulose,
and the cover is fastened so securely that the only
possible mode of opening is by tearing the paper.</p>

<p><i>Willesden
Welded Goods</i> are prepared by simultaneously
dipping two or more sheets of paper and pressing them into
one compact homogeneous sheet whilst the surfaces are still
in a gelatinous state. In this way a continuous length of
fabric of extraordinary durability is produced that is scarcely
affected by water, even when heated in it for some weeks at
a pressure of 60 lbs. per square inch.</p>

<p>As, on drying fabrics treated with cu­pram­mon­ium solution,
the whole of the ammonia in the solution absorbed by them
is volatilised, it is necessary, in order to make the process
economical, to collect and re-use this ammonia. This is
effected by conducting the drying process in closed chambers,
from which the ammonia gas is conducted by suitable
appliances and recovered.</p>

<p>In addition to the advantages already mentioned, it may
be stated that Willesden paper is much less inflammable than
ordinary paper.</p>

<p>Among the many uses to which Willesden goods can be applied,
the following may be cited:—Roofs and sheds; huts and tents;
partitions; tanks and pipes; damp-proof foundations; underlining
slates; sails, awnings, &#x26;c. &#x26;c.</p>

<p>Our imports of “rags and other paper-making materials”
from Norway increased from 23,483 tons, value 138,098<i>l.</i>, in
1880, to 48,199 tons, 279,679<i>l.</i>, in 1884, mainly owing to the
development of the wood-pulp industry. Later figures will
probably show a similar increment. The same articles from
Denmark grew from 359 tons, 3406<i>l.</i>, in 1880, to 1403 tons,
16,352<i>l.</i>, from the same cause. German statistics have even
a stronger upward tendency: 11,587 tons, 196,051<i>l.</i>, in 1880,
against 196,051 tons, 331,591<i>l.</i>, in 1884. Our receipts of
esparto from Algeria show an advance, but not a marked one,
being 60,612 tons, 421,343<i>l.</i>, in 1880, and 88,357 tons, 515,232<i>l.</i>,
in 1884. But shipments of the same fibre from Spain show
a decline from 51,413 tons, 454,713<i>l.</i>, in 1880, to 40,159 tons,
314,927<i>l.</i>, in 1884; and from Morocco they have fallen
away from 2879 tons, 18,231<i>l.</i>, in 1880, to 260 tons, 1290<i>l.</i>,
in 1884; while the figures relating to Tunis and Tripoli
also show a disposition to recede, though not at such a rapid
rate.</p>

<p>The wood-pulp industry of Norway for the year 1886
shows a very large increase upon the figures of a few years
back, albeit prices have ruled very low. This latter circumstance
is attributed, not so much to over-production, as to
excessive competition among the sellers of this article. The
quantity exported during the year 1886 is about 120,000 tons;
in the year 1885 it was 107,651 tons; 1884, 88,220 tons;
1883, 70,464 tons; 1882, 58,884 tons; 1881, 42,194 tons;
1880, 26,055 tons. Several of the old works have extended
their production during the past year, and several new
establishments are in the course of erection, so the production
this year may probably be put at 150,000 tons wood pulp
with 50 per cent. water. The greatest part of the Norwegian
wood pulp is exported to England, France, and Belgium; in
Russia, the increase in the duty has stopped business, and the
same can almost be said of Germany. America, too, has
drawn part of her supply from Norway, but this trade is not
expected to continue. <span class="xxpn" id="p225">{225}</span></p>

very nearly as high an aggregate value as the imports, and
have increased in much the same proportion in corresponding

<h3 class="h3afterh2"><i>The Yaryan Process of Evaporation.</i></h3>

<p class="pfirst">This process,
the invention of Mr. H. J. Yaryan, of Toledo,
Ohio, U.S.A., has been considerably developed in America in
its several applications, and as we have authentic information
of its successful working for the recovery of soda in some of
the largest paper-mills in the States, we think it deserving
of mention. The principle of the process is that of “multiple
effects,” upon which, indeed, all the modern methods of
economic evaporation are based. The principle may be
briefly explained as follows:—A liquid is converted into
vapour under ordinary conditions of boiling, by overcoming
the pressure of the atmosphere upon its surface. The quantity
of heat required to vaporise, as also the temperature of
the ebullition, will be less as the pressure to be overcome is
less. Further, the vapour continuously driven off carries
with it a quantity of heat, which is its heat of condition or
latent heat. This heat it imparts to any colder body (e. g. a
further quantity of the same liquid) with which it comes in
contact, direct or indirect; if the quantity of the latter be
relatively small, it will raise its temperature approximately
to that of the ebullition of the first liquid. If now the pressure
(atmospheric) on the surface of the latter be slightly
reduced, by any means, it will boil. The vapour from this
can be made to boil a third quantity of the liquid, under a
further diminished pressure.</p>

<p>The successive effects in economic evaporation consist,
therefore, in utilising the latent heat of a vapour given off
from a liquid under a certain pressure (e. g. that of the
atmosphere) to vaporise a further quantity of the liquid
under a pressure maintained by mechanical means below
that of the first. In the ordinary methods the vapour does
its work in the successive effects by passage through systems
of tubes, the liquid to be heated being in contact externally;
in the Yaryan system, on the other
hand, the arrangement <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
is reversed. The liquid to be evaporated traverses the
system of tubes which are heated externally by the vapours.
At the end of each effect, the liquid is caused to impinge, in
a special chamber, upon a disc: in this way a complete
separation of liquid and vapour is effected, each then passing
on to the next effect, the former through the tube-system,
the latter to the chamber inclosing these. The flow of liquid
is maintained by a force-pump, and the diminished pressure
by a vacuum-pump suitably disposed. This system differs
from that described on page
<a href="#p180" title="go to p. 180">180</a>, in that the evaporation is
continuous, the dilute liquors entering the apparatus and
the highly concentrated liquors leaving it in an unbroken
stream. The rate of flow is such that the evaporation of
the caustic liquors from wood boiling from 8–10° to 80°
Twaddell, in a quadruple effect, requires only a few minutes.
At the latter concentration it is ready for the incineration
process, which by means of a rotary furnace, such as that of
Mr. J. W. Hammond, of the firm of S. D. Warren and Co.,
is also effected continuously. It is found, moreover, that the
excess of heat available from this process is sufficient for the
evaporation.</p>
</div><!--chapter-->

<div class="section"><div class="padtopb">
<h3 class="h3afterh2"><i>Ferric
Oxide Causticising Process.</i></h3>

<p>The principle of this process is the expulsion of the carbonic
acid from sodium carbonate by ferric oxide at high temperatures;
this oxide playing the part of a weak acid, entering
into a loose combination with the soda, which is overcome
by water in the subsequent lixiviation process, the ferric
oxide being regenerated and a solution of caustic soda
obtained.</p>

<p>The ferric oxide is therefore continuously available. The
main features of the process, disregarding the question of
commercial economy, are (1) that it leaves no by-products to
be disposed of, (2) that it enables the manufacturer to
produce directly, without evaporation, a highly concentrated
caustic lye.</p>

<p>This process has been worked out under the auspices of
Messrs. Brunner, Mond, &#x26; Co., and there is every reason to
expect an extensive application of so
simple a method.</p></div><!--padtopb--></div><!--section-->

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE:

<p class="pfirst">Original spelling and grammar have been
generally retained, with some exceptions noted below. Original
printed page numbers are shown like this: {52}. Footnotes
have been relabeled 1–18, and moved from within paragraphs to
nearby locations between paragraphs. The transcriber produced
the cover image and hereby assigns it to the public domain.
Original page images are available from archive.org—search for
“gri_33125007981968”.</p>

<p>Some missing full stops have been inserted. Many ditto
marks have been eliminated, replaced by repeated text. Enlarged
curly brackets “}{”   employed to combine information in two or more lines or columns have
been eliminated, by restructuring text if necessary. One such instance
is the table on page <a href="#p039" title="go to p. 39">39</a>. The table on page <a href="#p044" title="go to p. 44">44</a> and some other large
tables were moved from their original locations inside a paragraph of
text to nearby locations between paragraphs. The page 44 table was
also divided into two parts, after column six. Illustrations have also
been moved from within paragraphs of text to nearby locations between
paragraphs.</p>

<li>Page <a href="#p136" title="go to p. 136">136</a>. “being
therefore equivalent to one mgrm” is retained, but presumably
should be read “being therefore equivalent to ten mgrm”.</li>

<li>Page <a href="#fn15" title="go to footnote 15">196n</a>.
The note had no anchor in the text. A new one
